Description: Prudence is an open source container and framework for scalable web frontends and network services.
 It comes in several flavors: Python, Ruby, Clojure, JavaScript, PHP and Groovy. Your applications can support
 rich clients (AJAX), thin clients (pure HTML), and happy mixes between the two. Prudence addresses real-world,
 practical concerns, from virtual hosting and URI rewriting to flexible server- and client-side caching.
