<h1>Prudence Example Application</h1>
<p>
	Welcome to Prudence!	
</p>
<p>
	This application is meant to provide straightforward reference examples of
	Prudence's core features, for you to examine the source code and configuration so that you can
	get a sense of how the pieces fit together. It's not a very useful application
	otherwise, and it's also quite repetitive, as each feature is implemented again in a different
	language. Click on the menu on the left to see them all.
</p>
<p>
	The multilingual examples are dynamically enabled according to which language engines
	you have installed in your container. By default, only the JavaScript examples will work.
	To install all languages:
</p>
<pre>sincerity add python : add ruby : add groovy : add clojure : add php : install</pre>
<p>
	To see a "real" demo application for Prudence, install Stickstick, which uses "AJAX"
	and a few data-driven resources (backed by a relational database) to allow for
	shared online sticky-notes. Stickstick is available in six editions: JavaScript, Python,
	Ruby, Clojure and Groovy. For example, to install the JavaScript edition:
</p>
<pre>sincerity add stickstick-javascript : install</pre>
