<h2>Filter</h2>
<p>
	In this simple example we've put a filter before all resources to count how many POST verbs hit the site.
</p>
<p>
	See the application's "routing.js" to see how the filter was configured.

<div class="hr"><hr /></div>
	
<form method="POST">
	<p><button type="submit">Add a count</button></p>
