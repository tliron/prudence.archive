		<h2>How to Choose a Flavor?</h2>
		
		<p>
			If you're starting a Prudence project from scratch, you may be overwhelmed by the selection of flavors.
			This guide may help you decide which one to use.
		</p>

		<h3>Python (Succulent!)</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> is a powerful object-oriented language, far richer in features than
			JavaScript and PHP, with many high-quality core and 3rd party libraries.
			Python has already proven itself as a web programming language with many excellent platforms.
		</p>
		<p>
			Python presents a unique challenge in a scriptlet environment, due to its reliance on indentation. However, because HTML is loose with
			whitespace, it's possible to force the whole file to adhere to Python's scheme. In fact, as many Python enthusiasts would argue, forcing your code
			to adhere to Python's indentation requirements can go a long way towards making it more readable and manageable.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the included example application we show how to use <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> as a data backend for Prudence.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			<i>Note:</i> Prudence Python was built primarily around <a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a>, but will also
			support <a href="http://jepp.sourceforge.net/">Jepp</a> if it's installed. For those cases where you need access to
			a natively built Python library that won't work on Jython, Jepp lets you run code on the CPython platform.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Ruby (Delectable!)</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> can do most of what Python can do and more. A true chameleon,
			it can adapt to many styles of code and programming. If something can be possible, Ruby allows it and supports it.
			Unlike Python, it has a very loose and forgiving syntax, which is perfect for scriptlets.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ruby's <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> platform has revolutionized web programming by offering elegant,
			powerful alternatives to working directly with HTTP. We hope Ruby web programmers will find in Prudence a
			refreshing alternative to Rails: elegantly embracing HTTP, instead of avoiding it.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Clojure (Scrumptious!)</h3>
		<p>
			Prudence's only functional flavor is a Lisp designed from the ground up for high concurrency. If you're serious about scaling,
			<a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> is the way to go. Though new, Clojure is based on one of the oldest programming languages around,
			and enjoys a rich tradition of elegant solutions for tough programming challenges.
		</p>
		<p>
			Clojure embraces the JVM, but also has a growing collection of nifty "contrib" libraries -- all included in Prudence.
			In the included example application, we show how to use Clojure's SQL library to access a data backend the Clojure way.
		</p>

		<h3>JavaScript (Savory!)</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> (a dialect of <a href="http://www.ecmascript.org/">ECMAScript</a>) is a sensible choice
			for "AJAX" and other rich web client applications, because it's the same language used by web browsers
			and other client platforms. Web developers are already proficient in JavaScript, and can quickly be brought on board to a server-side
			project. JavaScript lets you to write server-side and client-side code in the same language, and have both sides share code.
			Couple it with <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>, and you're on solid ground for rapid development.
			Of all the web programming languages, it's the one most widely deployed and with the most secure future.
		</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			JavaScript is an under-appreciated language. Though not as feature-rich as Python or Ruby, it's still very powerful. Its straightforward closure/prototype
			mechanisms allow it to support object-orientation, namespaces and other paradigms.
 			It's also been the target of much un-deserved angst due to the fickleness of in-browser development. Working with the DOM, cross-browser HTML rendering
 			quirks -- none of these are the faults of the language itself, and none of these are relevant to server-side development with Prudence.
		</p>
		<p>
			JavaScript does not have its own core libraries, making it the most minimal Prudence flavor. But this isn't necessarily a deficiency:
			instead, it uses the excellent JVM core.
		</p>
		
		<h3>PHP (Ambrosial!)</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> is, of course, ubiquitous. It's a simple language with the most mature libraries of any web programming language,
			and programmers are available with years of experience. It's also designed from the ground up as a programming language for the web.
		</p>
		<p>
			Prudence allows a smooth transition from traditional PHP HTML generation to REST resources. It supports PHP "superglobals" such
			as $_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE and $_FILE (but not $_SESSION) to make you feel right at home. It also adds many new features to conventional HTML generation:
			fine-grained caching, high-performance templating languages, and more.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			<i>Note:</i> Prudence PHP was built around the open source edition of <a href="http://quercus.caucho.com/">Quercus</a>, which does not
			feature JVM bytecode compilation, available in the non-free professional edition. Nevertheless, we found it an excellent performer! 
		</p>

		<h3>Groovy (Luscious!)</h3>
		<p>
			In some ways, <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> is the best of this bunch. It has all the flexibility of Ruby, but is
			designed from the ground up to enhance and extend Java. Java programmers would immediately feel at home, while gaining access to
			far less restrictive programming paradigms. Groovy makes Java... groovy.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you know your project will require a lot of interaction with Java libraries, Groovy is a terrific -- and fun! -- choice.
			(Note that other Prudence flavors also offer JVM interaction, but Groovy does it best.)
