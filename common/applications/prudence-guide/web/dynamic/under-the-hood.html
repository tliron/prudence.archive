<h2>Under the Hood</h2>

<p>Prudence assembles together of many open source libraries,
some of which were designed specifically for Prudence.</p>

<p>Consider this as Prudence's "acknowledgments" page. Hundreds of people
have worked on these libraries, and we're grateful to all of them for
sharing their hard work, for embracing open source licensing, and for
adhering to design principles that allow reuse of their work in other
projects, such as Prudence.</p>


<h3>1. Restlet</h3>

<p>Prudence went through many transformations before aligning itself
strongly with Restlet. First, we experimented with
<a href="https://facelets.dev.java.net/">Facelets</a>, but ended up giving up on <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/">JSF</a>,
its complex lifecycle, and on the promise of component-based web development in general.
Then, we designed REST architectures using servlets and
<a href="http://threecrickets.com/succinct/">Succinct</a> templates,
but found it awkward to force servlets into a REST architecture. Discovering
<a href="http://www.restlet.org/">Restlet</a> was a breath of fresh air.
</p>

<p>Restlet's super-powers are three:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Clean abstraction of HTTP requests, responses and headers
	over best-of-breed engines, such as <a href="https://grizzly.dev.java.net/">Grizzly</a>,
	<a href="http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/">Jetty</a> and <a href="http://www.jboss.org/netty">Netty</a>.
	Automatically gain the scalable advantages of non-blocking I/O and even asynchronous request
	handling (which will be even better supported in Restlet 2.1).
	Restlet transparently handles conditional requests, content negotiation,
	and other complicated HTTP labor.
	</li>

	<li>Powerful URI routing and manipulation. Finally, an elegant
	URI front-face to users and other service consumers, with support for
	virtual hosting, rewriting, templating, and other useful real-world
	features. Truly the Swiss army knife of URIs!</li>

	<li>Straightforward data representation and consumption through a diverse
	set of extensions using a variety of libraries. Expose your data using
	any standard format, and even convert it on-the-fly.
	Easily parse data from clients.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Restlet is a great library, with a great ecosystem of extensions.
We missed, though, some of the advantages of having a servlet container:
easy deployment and configuration, centralized logging, etc. We also missed
having JSP at our fingertips to quickly push out dynamic HTML.
</p>

<p>Prudence is meant to fill in these gaps, and do everything better.
</p>


<h3>2. The JVM</h3>

<p>How wonderful that the best-performing, most robust and most widely ported
virtual machine is now open source? How wonderful that you can use it with
JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Clojure, PHP and others languages?</p>

<p>We strongly recommend the JVM for enterprise and internet applications,
even if you're not particularly fond of Java (the programming language).
</p>


<h3>3. Jython, JRuby, Groovy, Clojure, Rhino, Quercus</h3>

<p>Prudence would hardly be as exciting if you had to use Java.
</p>

<p>These open source language engines have allowed us to extend the power of
Prudence, REST and the JVM to languages outside of Java. Some of these engines
are huge, complex projects, and are in fact the biggest libraries
included in Prudence. We strongly recommend you join in the communities surrounding
the language engines corresponding to your chosen Prudence flavor.
</p>

<p>In particular, we want to point out <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>
as an outstanding innovation in concurrent programming.
</p>


<h3>4. Scripturian</h3>

<p>To make Prudence applications easy to deploy, they could not be
traditional Java. The cycle of compilation and packaging is unnecessarily
cumbersome. Though we could have implemented something like the on-the-fly
Java compilation done in JSP, but we felt that, if that's the route to go,
many choices open up besides Java, and that these languages are more
relevant to Prudence's goals.
</p>

<p>
There are many terrific JVM-based languages out there.
Unfortunately, we found that integrating these languages into
Prudence was anything but trivial. Each implementation had its
own idea of what was acceptable support for embedding. We tried
to standardize on JSR-223 (the Java scripting standard), but found
that adherence to the spec was inconsistent. We hacked and hacked
and hacked. We even submitted patches to fix broken implementations
of various languages. All in all, we probably spent more time on
this than on any other aspect of Prudence.
</p>

<p>Since we think software other than Prudence can make use of
our hard-won gains, we've abstracted and separated our language
integration code as the <a href="http://threecrickets.com/scripturian/">Scripturian</a> library. 
</p>


<h3>5. Succinct</h3>

<p><a href="http://threecrickets.com/succinct/">Succinct</a> also
started as a part of Prudence that branched out
into an independent library. We created it because we wanted
straightforward, scalable templating built in to Prudence, and
were unsatisfied by other open source offerings.
We think you'll like it.
</p>


<h3>6. Jygments</h3>

<p>Yet another Prudence side-project!</p>

<p>For Prudence's debug mode, we wanted good syntax highlighting
for viewing source code. We found nothing adequate enough in the
Java world, though we fell in love with Pygments. For a while,
we ran Pygments in Prudence via Jython, but found it too heavy
for this particular use case. Thus, <a href="http://jygments.tigris.org/">Jygments</a>
was born as a port of
Pygments to Java.
</p>


<h3>7. H2</h3>

<p>We're great fans of this lean and mean database engine! It
has allowed us to distribute Prudence with a fully-functioning
data-drive demo application, without any external dependencies.
We're proud to introduce <a href="http://www.h2database.com/">H2</a>,
through Prudence, to more people, and we believe you'll find it fast
enough, reliable enough, and flexible enough for many production
environments.
