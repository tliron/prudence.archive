<h2>Prudence As a Daemon</h2>

<p>In production environments, it's best to run Prudence as a daemon in Unix-like systems
or a service in Windows, via a lightweight wrapper. This will provide proper process
monitoring and control. For example, if Prudence's JVM crashes for some reason, hangs, grabs
too much CPU or RAM, the wrapper can automatically shut down and even restart it.</p>

<p>While Prudence comes with the necessary configuration files for this, it does not include
the actual wrapper, which you will need to install manually. There are two reasons for this:
YAJSW, our preferred wrapper, is too big a download as of now, and including it in
Prudence make it too heavy. As for Tanuki's JSW, its license will not allow us to
distribute it with Prudence. It does not, however, bar you from downloading and installing
it yourself.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>Ready for a short history lesson?</p>

<p>The copyright for JSW is held by its developer, Tanuki Software. Up to version 3.2,
Tanuki released JSW under a very permissive license, making it very popular in many
open source projects. However, it has since been distributed under the GPL 2.0 (and also via
a commercial license). We applaud Tanuki's commitment to open source, and are big fans of the
GPL. However, the GPL makes it impossible to distribute JSW with open source projects
using less restrictive licenses, such as Prudence. Many projects have kept distributing
version 3.2 of JSW, which is now out of date and missing bug fixes.</p>

<p>For less restrictive open source projects, the gap has been filled by YAJSW, which
sought not only to be a drop-in replacement for JSW, but also to go beyond it with many
additional features.</p>

<h3>YAJSW</h3>

<p><a href="http://yajsw.sourceforge.net/">YAJSW</a> is cleverly written in 100% Java, using
<a href="https://jna.dev.java.net/">JNA</a> to handle the native operating-system-dependent
features. It is an powerful tool with many great features.</p>

<h4>Monitoring via JMX</h4>

<h3>JSW</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/">JSW</a> is written in C rather than Java,
making it more lightweight than YAJSW. Nevertheless, it has binaries for many
operating systems.
