<h2>Static Web</h2>

<p>Prudence attaches your application's /web/static/ subdirectory to
URLs, making files there available via HTTP GET. In other words,
/static/web/ is a "web server." It's a convenient place for storing
immutable resources that your clients will need to run your application:
images, styles, scripts, etc.</p>

<p>You're likely, though, wondering if /web/static/ is merely a convenience,
and if you'd be better off using Apache or other dedicated web servers
instead of Prudence to serve your the static files.</p>

<p>Our recommendation is to take that route only if those web
servers offer important features that you won't find in Prudence.
Remember that Prudence has many powerful features, including URL
redirecting, rewriting and routing, and that Prudence's non-blocking
I/O actually does a great job at serving files. You will likely not
see many performance or scalability gains replacing /web/static/ with
standard Apache.</p>

<h3>Mapping MIME Types</h3>

<pre>
application.metadataService.addExtension('php', MediaType.TEXT_HTML)
</pre>

<h3>Replacing Grizzly</h3>

<p>
Grizzly can be replaced with <a href="http://jboss.org/netty">Netty</a>, a competing
non-blocking I/O server with slightly different performance characteristics,
and <a href="http://www.mortbay.org/jetty/">Jetty</a>, which offers similar performance,
but with many more features. Or, use any other connector supported by
<a href="http://www.restlet.org/">Restlet</a>.
