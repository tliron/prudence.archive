		<h2>About Prudence</h2>
		<p>
			Prudence is an open source framework and container for scalable web frontends and network services.
			It comes in <a href="flavors/">several flavors</a>: Python, Ruby, Groovy, Clojure, JavaScript and PHP.
			Your applications can support rich clients (AJAX), thin clients (pure HTML), and happy mixes between the two.
			Prudence addresses real-world, practical concerns, from virtual hosting and URI rewriting to flexible server
			and client-side caching.
		</p>
		<p align="center">

		</p>
		<p>
			Prudence stands out from other web frameworks and containers in that it is designed from the ground up to scale.
			It adheres to proven <a href="rest">REST</a> principles, which work with the web's inherently scalable
			architecture, rather than trying to awkwardly force it into other paradigms. Code runs on a JVM:
			dependable, fast and portable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each flavor comes with a data-driven demo application,
			showing how to integrate Prudence with data backends.
			The detailed <a href="guide/tutorial/">tutorial</a> is a great place to start!
		</p>
		<p>
			All you need is a Java 5 Standard Edition environment or above.
			Note that no Java coding is necessary. Also, Prudence does not
			require or use Java Enterprise Edition extensions.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you do use Java, you will also find Prudence most useful!
			Prudence works well as a <a href="guide/non-prudence/">container for
			your Restlet applications</a>: a terrific, lean REST-centric substitute for
			servlet/JEE containers and GWT. Prudence is also available as an embeddable, standalone library.

		<h3>Features</h3>
		<p>
			Prudence makes it very easy to create <a href="resource-tests/">REST resources</a>.
			In seconds, you can write code to process and answer an HTTP "PUT" or "GET" with a representation of your resource,
			and attach this code to a URL. Format negotiation with the client is handled automatically.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, Prudence offers classic <a href="html-tests/">HTML generation</a> by letting you embed code "scriptlets"
			into text documents, similarly to how PHP, JSP and ASP work.
			Scriptlets can be written in any of the supported programming languages, or you can choose better-performing,
			more manageable templating languages: <a href="http://threecrickets.com/succinct/">Succinct</a> and
			<a href="http://velocity.apache.org/">Velocity</a> are both included.
			Prudence goes a step beyond similar platforms by offering fine-grained caching
			of the generated results.
		</p>
		<p>
			Development is quick, powerful and fun. Prudence picks up and compiles your changes on-the-fly,
			making sure to update its cached code base. It offers runtime debugging information and robust
			logging.
		</p>

		<h3>Diligence and Prudence</h3>
		<p>
			We at <a href="http://threecrickets.com/">Three Crickets</a> originally designed Prudence to
			help us create our own products. Its counterpart is Diligence, a super-scalable data-driving backend.
			Together, they make <a href="http://threecrickets.com/diligenceandprudence/">Diligence and Prudence</a>,
			a complete stack for easily creating cloud-ready applications in the language of your choice.
