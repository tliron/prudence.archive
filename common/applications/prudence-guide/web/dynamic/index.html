		<h2>About Prudence</h2>
		<p>
			Prudence is an open source framework for building scalable web frontends and network services.
			It comes in <a href="flavors/">several flavors</a>: Python, Ruby, Groovy, Clojure, JavaScript and PHP.
			Your applications can support rich clients (AJAX), thin clients (pure HTML), and happy mixes between the two.
			Not just a framework, Prudence also works as a powerful and flexible container for your web site,
			addressing real-world, practical concerns, from virtual hosting and URI rewriting to caching.
		</p>
		<p align="center">

		<p>
			Prudence stands out from other web frameworks in that it is designed from the ground up to scale.
			It adheres to proven <a href="rest">REST</a> principles, which work with the web's inherently scalable
			architecture, rather than trying to force it into other, limiting paradigms. HTTP is handled via
			non-blocking I/O, which keeps your application responsive even under high loads. Code runs on a JVM:
			dependable, fast and portable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each flavor comes with a relevant example data-driven application,
			showing how to integrate Prudence with a data backend.
			The detailed <a href="guide/tutorial/">tutorial</a> is a great place to start!
		</p>
		<p>
			All you need is a Java 5 Standard Edition environment or above.
			Note that no Java coding is necessary. Also, Prudence does not
			require or use Java Enterprise Edition extensions.
		</p>
		<p>
			For Java developers, Prudence is also available as an embeddable, standalone library.
			It also works well as a <a href="guide/non-prudence/">container</a> for
			your Restlet applications.

		<h3>Features</h3>
		<p>
			Prudence makes it very easy to create <a href="resource-tests/">REST resources</a>.
			In seconds, you can write code to process and answer an HTTP "PUT" or "GET" with a representation of your resource,
			and attach this code to a URL. Format negotiation with the client is handled automatically.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, Prudence offers classic <a href="html-tests/">HTML generation</a> by letting you embed code "scriptlets"
			into text documents, similarly to how PHP, JSP and ASP work.
			Scriptlets can be written in any of the supported programming languages, or you can choose better-performing,
			more manageable templating languages: <a href="http://threecrickets.com/succinct/">Succinct</a> and
			<a href="http://velocity.apache.org/">Velocity</a> are both included.
			Prudence goes a step beyond similar platforms by offering high-performance streaming and fine-grained caching
			of the generated results.
		</p>
		<p>
			Development is quick, powerful and fun. Prudence picks up and compiles your changes on-the-fly,
			making sure to update its cached code base.

		<h3>Diligence and Prudence</h3>
		<p>
			We at <a href="http://threecrickets.com/">Three Crickets</a> originally designed Prudence to
			help us create our own products. Its counterpart is Diligence, a super-scalable data-driving backend.
			Together, they make <a href="http://threecrickets.com/diligenceandprudence/">Diligence and Prudence</a>,
			a complete stack for easily creating cloud-ready applications in the language of your choice.
			We used Diligence and Prudence to build <a href="http://threecrickets.com/sneeze/">Sneeze!</a>
			in just 10 days, using nothing but JavaScript!
