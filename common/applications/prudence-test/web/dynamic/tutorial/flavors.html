		<h2>How to Choose a Flavor?</h2>
		
		<p>
			If you're starting a Prudence project from scratch, you may be overwhelmed by the selection of flavors.
			This guide may help you decide which one to use.
		</p>

		<h3>Python</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> is a powerful language, far richer in features than PHP and JavaScript,
			and can compete well with PHP for the quality and maturity of its libraries.
		</p>
		<p>
			It does, however, present a unique challenge in a scriptlet environment, due to its reliance on indentation. However, because HTML is loose with
			whitespace, it's possible to force the whole file to adhere to Python's scheme. In fact, as many Python enthusiasts would argue, forcing your code
			to adhere to Python's indentation requirements can go a long way towards making it more readable and manageable.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			<i>Note:</i> The Python flavor of Prudence can use either the Jython or Jepp engines,
			but Jython is recommended, because Prudence's use of Jepp is currently limited.
			At this time, you cannot create REST resources in Python/Jepp,
			though you can embed Python/Jepp scriptlets into text.
			(This is true for Jepp version 2.3.) 
		</p>
		
		<h3>Ruby</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> is a relatively new language that can do most of what Python can do and more.
			Unlike Python, it has a very loose and forgiving syntax, which is perfect for scriptlets. It can work with many styles of code,
			and as such it would be relatively easy to transition to Ruby from any of the other languages supported by Prudence.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ruby has some excellent libraries, and may be very productive for developing large applications.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Groovy</h3>
		<p>
			In some ways, <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> is the best of this bunch. It has all the flexibility of Ruby, but is designed from the
			ground up to integrate strongly into Java. That means that any Java library is also a Groovy library. (This is true to various extents for the other
			programming languages here, but Groovy does it best.) Additionally, Groovy is enjoying a huge growth in specialized adaptations and Groovy-specific
			libraries.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you know your project will require heavy interaction with Java libraries, Groovy is a terrific -- and fun -- choice.
		</p>

		<h3>Clojure</h3>
		<p>
			Prudence's only functional flavor is a dialect of Lisp designed from the ground up for heavy concurrency. If you are serious about scaling,
			<a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> is the way to go. Though new, Clojure is based on one of the oldest programming languages around,
			and enjoys a rich history of elegant solutions for tough computational problems.
		</p>

			Three Crickets &hearts; Clojure
		</p>

		<h3>JavaScript</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> (a dialect of <a href="http://www.ecmascript.org/">ECMAScript</a>) is a sensible choice
			for "AJAX" and other rich web client applications, because it's the same language used by web browsers
			and other client platforms. Web developers are already proficient in JavaScript, and can quickly be brought on board to a server-side
			project. JavaScript lets you to write server-side and client-side code in the same language, and have both sides share code.
			Couple it with <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>, and you're on solid ground for rapid development.
		</p>
		<p>
			Though not as feature-rich as Python or Ruby, JavaScript is still
			very powerful, and can support object-orientation, namespaces and other paradigms. Many libraries exist to help you with this.
		</p>
		
		<h3>PHP</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> is, of course, ubiquitous. It's a simple language with the most mature libraries of any web programming language, and programmers are available with years
			of experience. It's also designed from the ground up as a programming language for the web.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			<i>Note:</i> The PHP flavor of Prudence is currently limited.
			At this time, you cannot create REST resources in PHP,
			though you can embed PHP scriptlets into text.
			(This is true for Quercus version 3.2.1.) 
		</p>
		<p>		
			Also, some of PHP's benefits and libraries will not be immediately usable under Prudence. PHP's built-in web features, such as $_SESSION and $_COOKIE,
			won't work. You'll need to use the Prudence versions instead, and some libraries may expect PHP's built-in features.
			(It may be possible to write a transition library -- any volunteers?)
