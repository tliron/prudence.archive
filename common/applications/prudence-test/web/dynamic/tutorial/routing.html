<h2>Routing</h2>

<p>"Routing" in Prudence refers to how URLs are attached to resources. In
fact, this is often not a simple one-to-one relationship, and different
routes may be selected according to changing circumstances.</p>

<h3>Directories As Slugs</h3>

<p>Prudence provides straightforward, hierarchical, dynamic routing between
your directory structure and URLs. Simply put, file paths are mapped directly
to URLs. Files added at runtime will automatically create new URLs for them.
To keep the URLs pretty, filename extensions are optional. The filename
extension, though serves two purposes: in the case of code in /resources/,
/libraries/ or other places, the extension selects the language engine which
will run the code; in the case of files in /web/dynamic/ and /web/static/,
it helps select the default MIME type for representations. This selection
is based on the meta data service, which you can customize (see
<a href="static-web">static web</a>). Embedded language code in /web/dynamic/
files can also programatically change the returns MIME types (see <a
href="resoruces">resources</a>)).
