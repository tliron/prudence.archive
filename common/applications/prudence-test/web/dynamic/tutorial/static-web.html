<h2>Static Web</h2>

<p>Prudence attaches your application's /web/static/ subdirectory to
URLs, making files there available via HTTP GET. In other words,
/static/web/ is a "web server." It's a convenient place for storing
immutable resources that your clients will need to run your application:
images, styles, scripts, etc.</p>

<p>You're likely, though, wondering if its merely a convenience, and
if you'd be better off using Apache or other dedicated web servers
instead of Prudence to serve your the static files.</p>

<p>Our recommendation is to take that route only if those web
servers offer important features that you won't find in Prudence.
Remember, for example, that Prudence can do URL redirecting and routing.
Otherwise, Prudence's non-blocking I/O actually does a great job at
serving files, and you will likely not see performance or scalability
gains by using Apache instead.</p>
