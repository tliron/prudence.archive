<h2>Integrating Restlet Code</h2>

<p>Though applications can be written in Prudence without a single line of Java
code, Prudence also acts as a useful container for existing Restlet applications, resources
or other restlets, written in Java or other JVM languages.</p>

<p>Why use Prudence for a Restlet application that already works?</p>

<p>Prudence makes it easy to handle the bootstrapping and <a href="routing">routing</a> of your
applications, and the <a href="prudence-admin">Prudence administration application</a> and
<a href="logging">logging</a> features make it easier to deploy
and manage multiple applications together. These issues have more to do with your application's
configuration, rather than its functionality, and it can be useful to handle them outside of the
Java build process, using live, dynamic languages.
</p>

<p>This need is also fulfilled by servlet and Java Enterprise Edition containers, such as
Tomcat, Resin and JBoss. Indeed, Restlet has a JEE edition, and good support for servlets.
However, if all you need is a deployment container, Prudence can serve as a straightforward,
pure REST alternative.
</p>

<h3>Custom Resources</h3>

<p>Use your application's routing file to attach your resources, or otherwise manage
routing. Example:
</p>

<pre>
// Prudence defaults
document.container.include('defaults/application/routing');

// MyOrg resources
router.attach('data/item/{id}', classLoader.loadClass('org.myorg.ItemResource'));
router.attach('data/items', classLoader.loadClass('org.myorg.ItemsResource'));
</pre>

<p>You can also change Prudence's default routing by detaching and re-attaching routes:
</p>

<pre>
// Wrap static web in JavaScript minifying filter
importClass(org.myorg.JavaScriptMinifyFilter);
router.detach(staticWeb);
router.attach(
	fixURL(staticWebBaseURL),
	new JavaScriptMinifyFilter(application.context, staticWeb, File(applicationBasePath + staticWebBasePath)))
	.matchingMode = Template.MODE_STARTS_WITH;
</pre>

<h3>Custom Application</h3>

<p>
By default, Prudence creates an instance of the standard Restlet Application class.
Use your application's application file to override this, and create and configure your own
application. Example:
</p>

<pre>
// MyOrgApplication
importClass(org.myorg.MyOrgApplication);
var application = new MyOrgApplication();

// Install our custom tunnel service
importClass(org.myorg.MyOrgTunnelService);
application.tunnelService = new MyOrgTunnelService(MyOrgTunnelService.MODE_QUERY);

// These attributes are specific to MyOrgApplication
application.databaseURI = 'mysql://localhost/myorg';
application.useTransactions = true;
</pre>
