<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>Resources as API.</p>

<p>There's no need to maintain a separate "internal API," with REST resources serving
as an "external API." Your resources are available internally, without having to use
HTTP. A single, uniform API is more maintainable, and less prone to bugs.
Additionally, the internal connectivity is an easy way to test your resources.
See below for internal access to your resources.</p>

<h3>CRUD</h3>

<h3>Representation</h3>


<h3>Concurrency Concerns</h3>


<h3>Mixing Languages</h3>

<h3>Accessing Resources Internally</h3>

<p>Prudence has very easy-to-use REST client, and a rich API for creating
and manipulation data <a href="representations">representations</a>.
You can use it to access your own resources, as well as resources from
other applications in your Prudence installation. Examples:
</p>

<pre>
importClass(org.restlet.resource.ClientResource);

// A resource in our application
var r = new ClientResource('riap://application/hosts');
print(r.get().text);

// A resource from another application on our host
var id = 9;
var r = new ClientResource('riap://host/stickstick/note/' + id + '/');
var note = JSON.parse(String(r.get(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON).text));
</pre>

<h3>Accessing External REST Services</h3>

<p>The client API mentioned above can also be used to access external
resources from anywhere on the web. Examples:
</p>

<pre>
importClass(org.restlet.resource.ClientResource);

// An external resource
var r = new ClientResource('http://www.threecrickets/prudence/data/rhino');
print(r.get().text);
</pre>

<p>Note that for the above to work, you need HTTP configured in your clients
file:</p>

<pre>
component.clients.add(Protocol.HTTP);
</pre>
