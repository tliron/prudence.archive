<h2>Prudence File Structure</h2>


<h3>/bin/</h3>

<p>Use run.sh for Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux and
Mac OS X, and run.bat for Windows.</p>

<p>When Prudence starts, it will print out a simple welcome message
with its version, its servers and and available applications. From then on,
Prudence will avoid sending output to the console, and instead output to
rolling logs under the /logs/ directory.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>Important: These run scripts are there for getting you quickly
up and running, however it is strongly recommended that you run
<a href="daemon">Prudence as a daemon</a> for production systems.
</p>
</div>


<h3>/applications/</h3>

<p>This is where you put your applications, each occupying a
subdirectory. Your application's subdirectory name serves as a useful
default name for your application. It is also the default base URL, and
the default logging name. You can change any of these default easily.</p>

<p>More about the structure of applications <a href="application-structure">here</a>.</p>


<h3>/logs/</h3>

<p>This is where your rolling logs will appear. Prudence logs are
highly configurable and powerful. In particular, your web.log will show
all requests hitting your Prudence server, using a standard format that
can be consumes and analyzed by software.</p>

<p>More on logging <a href="logging">here</a>.</p>


<h3>/instance/</h3>

<p>This is where the Prudence instance gets initialized. The
instance is the overall container which manages the servers and the
applications.</p>

<p>Most instance and application configuration files are written
in programming language code, rather than XML or other configuration
formats.</p> 

<p>This is an enormous advantage! It means you can have your
configuration be dynamic -- the same file can work differently depending
on different deployment environments and runtime circumstances.
For example, you can deploy the same instance to a development
environment, where it will start various debugging processes and logs,
and a production environment, where it will optimize for
performance and scale. You can even have different optimizations
for different deployments. For example, a weak cloud-based instance
with a single virtual CPU might be different from a dedicated box
with 8 cores and a lot of RAM. You can dynamically test for the
presence of installed optional components, etc.
</p>


<h3>/defaults/</h3>

<p>Here you'll find defaults used in /instance/ and /applications/.
Generally, you'll not want to edit these, but instead override them
there. Prudence tries to make configuration easy by using sensible default
behavior, and making it easy to override it. However, you can always
edit these files directly if necessary.</p>

<p>All files here are straightforward code.
They're really nothing much more than scripts for bootstrapping the
Prudence. Going through them can give you some idea of how Prudence
assembles its parts together.</p>


<h3>/conf/</h3>

<p>There are a few essential configuration files here. Most
important is logging.conf, but you will also find some optional files to
help you configure Prudence to run as a daemon.</p>

<h3>/lib/</h3>

<p>Here you will find Prudence's main libraries as well as support
libraries. The basic directory is for Java libraries (JARs), but you may
find subdirectories for libraries in other languages, such as Python.</p>

<p>If you add your own JARs, make sure to edit run.sh or run.bat to
accommodate your additions.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>Java 6 can pick them up automatically. Daemon can,
too.</p>
