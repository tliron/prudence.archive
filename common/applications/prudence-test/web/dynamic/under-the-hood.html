<h2>Under the Hood</h2>

<p class="note">To do.</p>

<p>Prudence is an assembly of many different open source libraries,
one of which was designed specifically for Prudence.</p>

<p>Consider this Prudence's "acknowledgments" page. Hundreds of people
have worked on these libraries, and we're grateful to all of them for
sharing their hard work, for embracing open source licensing, and for
adhering to design principles that allow reuse of their work in other
projects, such as Prudence.</p>
