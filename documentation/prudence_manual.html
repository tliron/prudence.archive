<h1 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-1"></a>The Case for REST<a class="Label" name="../../rest/"> </a><a class="Label" name="../rest/"> </a>
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
There’s a lot of buzz about REST, but also a lot confusion about what it is and what it’s good for. This essay attempts to convey REST’s simple essence.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Let’s start, then, not at REST, but at an attempt to create a new architecture for building scalable applications. Our goals are for it to be minimal, straightforward, and still have enough features to be productive. We want to learn some lessons from the failures of other, more elaborate and complete architectures.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Let’s call ours a ‘‘resource-oriented architecture.’’
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1"></a>Resources
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Our base unit is a ‘‘resource,’’ which, like an object in object-oriented architectures, encapsulates data with some functionality. However, we’ve learned from object-orientation that implementing arbitrary interfaces is a recipe for complexity: proxy generation, support for arbitrary types, marshalling, etc. Instead, then, we’ll keep it simple and define a limited, unified interface that would be just useful enough.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
From our experience with relational databases, we’ve learned that a tremendous amount of power can be found in ‘‘CRUD’’: Create, Read, Update and Delete. If we support just these operations, our resources will already be very powerful, enjoying the accumulated wisdom and design patterns from the database world. 
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-2"></a>Identifiers
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
First, let’s start with a way of identifying our resources. We’ll define a name-based address space where our resources live. Each resource is ‘‘attached’’ to one or more addresses. We’ll allow for ‘‘/’’ as a customary separator to allow for hierarchical addressing schemes. For example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">/animal/dog/3
/animal/cat/12/image
/animal/cat/12/image/large
/animal/cat/12/specs
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In the above, we’ve allowed for different kinds of animals, a way of referencing individual animals, and a way of referencing specific aspects of these animals.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Let’s now go over CRUD operations in increasing order of complexity.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3"></a>Delete
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
‘‘Delete’’ is the most trivial operation. After sending ‘‘delete’’ to an identifier, we expect it to not exist anymore. Whether sub-resources in our hierarchy can exist or not, we’ll leave up to individual implementations. For example, deleting ‘‘/animal/cat/12/image’’ may or may not delete ‘‘/animal/cat/12/image/large’’.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Note that we don’t care about atomicity here, because we don’t expect anything to happen after our ‘‘delete’’ operation. A million changes can happen to our cat before our command is processed, but they’re all forgotten after ‘‘delete.’’ (See ‘‘update,’’ below, for a small caveat.)
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-4"></a>Read
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
‘‘Read’’ is a bit more complicated than ‘‘delete.’’ Since our resource might be changed by other clients, we want to make sure that there’s some kind of way to mark which version we are reading. This will allow us to avoid unnecessary reads if there hasn’t been any change.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Thus, we’ll need our resource-oriented architecture to support some kind of version tagging feature.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-5"></a>Update
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The problem with ‘‘update’’ is that it always references a certain version that we have ‘‘read’’ before. In some cases, though not all, we need some way to make sure that the data we expect to be there hasn’t changed since we’ve last ‘‘read’’ it. Let’s call this a ‘‘conditional update.’’
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Actually, we’ve oversimplified our earlier definition of ‘‘delete.’’ In some cases, we’d want a ‘‘conditional delete’’ to depend on certain expectations about the data. We might not want the resource deleted in some cases.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
So, we’ll need our resource-oriented architecture to support a ‘‘conditional’’ operation feature. 
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-6"></a>Create
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
This is our most complex operation. Our first problem is that our identifier might not exist yet, or might already be attached to a resource. One approach could be to try identifiers in sequence:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">Create: /animal/cat/13 -&gt; Error, already exists
Create: /animal/cat/14 -&gt; Error, already exists
Create: /animal/cat/15 -&gt; Error, already exists
...
Create: /animal/cat/302041 -&gt; Success!
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Obviously, this is not a scalable solution. Another approach could be to have a helper resource which provides us with the necessary ID:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">Read: /animal/cat/next -&gt; 14
Create: /animal/cat/14 -&gt; Oops, someone else beat us to 14!
Read: /animal/cat/next -&gt; 15
Create: /animal/cat/15 -&gt; Success!
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Of course, we can also have ‘‘/animal/cat/next’’ return unique IDs (such as GUIDs) to avoid duplications. If we never create our cat, they will be wasted, though. The main problem with this approach is that it requires two calls per creation: a ‘‘read,’’ and then a ‘‘create.’’ We can handle this in one call by allowing for ‘‘partial’’ creation, a ‘‘create’’ linked with an intrinsic ‘‘read’’:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">Create: /animal/cat -&gt; We send the data for the cat without the ID, and get back the same cat with an ID
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Other solutions exist, too. The point of this discussion is to show you that ‘‘create’’ is not trivial, but also that solutions to ‘‘create’’ already exist within the resource-oriented architecture we’ve defined. ‘‘Create,’’ though programmatically complex, does not require any new architectural features.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-7"></a>Aggregate Resources
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
At first glance, handling the problem of getting lots of resources at the same time, thus saving on the number of calls, can trivially be handled by the features we’ve listed so far. A common solution is to define a ‘‘plural’’ version of the ‘‘singular’’ resource:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">/animal/cats
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A ‘‘read’’ would give us all cats. But what if there are ten million cats? We can support paging. Again, we have a solution within our current feature set, using identifiers for each subset of cats:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">/animal/cats/100/200
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We can define the above to return no more than 100 cats: from the 100th, to the 200th. There’s a slight problem in this solution: the burden is on whatever component in our system handles mapping identifiers to resources. This is not terrible, but if we want our system to be more generic, it could help if things like ‘‘100 to 200’’ could be handled by our resource more directly. For convenience, let’s implement a simple parameter system for all commands:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">Read(100, 200): /animal/cats
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In the above, our mapping component only needs to know about ‘‘/animal/cats’’. The dumber our mapping component is, the easier it is to implement. 
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-8"></a>Formats
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The problem of supporting multiple formats seems similar, at first glance, to that of aggregate resources. Again, we could potentially solve it with command parameters:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">Read(UTF-8, Russian): /animal/cat/13
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This would give us a Russian, Unicode UTF-8 encoded version of our cat. Looks good, except that there is a potential problem: the client might prefer certain formats, but actually be able to handle others. It’s more a matter of preference than any precision. Of course, we can have another resource where all available formats are listed, but this would require an extra call, and also introduce the problem of atomicity—what if the cat changes between these calls? A better solution would be to have the client associate certain preferences per command, have our resource emit its capabilities, with the mapping component in between ‘‘negotiating’’ these two lists. This ‘‘negotiation’’ is a rather simple algorithm to choose the best mutually preferable format.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This would be a simple feature to add to our resource-oriented architecture, which could greatly help to decouple its support for multiple formats from its addressing scheme. 
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-9"></a>Shared State
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Shared state between the client and server is very useful for managing sessions and implementing basic security. Of course, it’s quite easy to abuse shared state, too, by treating it as a cache for data. We don’t want to encourage that. Instead, we just want a very simple shared state system.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We’ll allow for this by attaching small, named, shared state objects to every request and response to a command. Nothing fancy or elaborate. There is a potential security breach here, so we have to trust that all components along the way honor the relationship between client and server, and don’t allow other servers access to our shared state. 
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-10"></a>Summary of Features
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
So, what do we need?
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We need a way to map identifiers to resources. We need support for the four CRUD operations. We need support for ‘‘conditional’’ updates and deletes. We need all operations to support ‘‘parameters.’’ We need ‘‘negotiation’’ of formats. And, we need a simple shared state attachment feature.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This list is very easy to implement. It requires very little computing power, and no support for generic, arbitrary additions.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-11"></a>Transactions… Not!
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Before we go on, it’s worth mentioning one important feature which we did not require: transactions. Transactions are optional, and sometimes core features in many databases and distributed object systems. They can be extremely powerful, as they allow atomicity across an arbitrary number of commands. They are also, however, heavy to implement, as they require considerable shared state between client and server. Powerful as they are, it is possible to live without them. It’s possible, for example, to implement this atomicity within a single resource. This would require us to define special resources per type of transaction which we want to support, but it does remove the heavy burden of supporting arbitrary transactions from our architecture. With some small reluctance, then, we’ll do without transactions. 
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-12"></a>Let’s Do It!
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
OK, so now we know what we need, let’s go ahead and implement the infrastructure of components to handle our requirements. All we need is stacks for all supported clients, backend stacks for all our potential server platforms, middleware components to handle all the identifier routing, content negotiation, caching of data…
</div>
<div class="Indented">
…And thousands of man hours to develop, test, deploy, and integrate. Like any large-scale, enterprise architecture, even trivial requirements have to jump through the usual hoops set up by the sheer scale of the task. Behind every great architecture are the nuts and bolts of the infrastructure.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Wouldn’t it be great if the infrastructure already existed?
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-13"></a>The Punchline
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Well, duh. All the requirements for our resource-oriented architecture are already supported by HTTP:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Our resource identifiers are simple URLs. The CRUD operations are in the four HTTP verbs: PUT, GET, POST and DELETE. ‘‘Conditional’’ and ‘‘negotiated’’ modes are handled by headers, as are ‘‘cookies’’ for shared state. Version stamps are e-tags. Command parameters are query matrixes appended to URLs. It’s all there.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Most importantly, the infrastructure for HTTP is already fully deployed world-wide. TCP/IP stacks are part of practically every operating system; wiring, switching and routing are part and parcel; HTTP gateways, firewalls, load balancers, proxies, caches, filters, etc., are stable consumer components; certificate authorities, national laws, international agreements are already in place to support the complex inter-business interaction. Best of all, this available infrastructure is successfully maintained, with minimal down-time, by highly-skilled independent technicians, organizations and component vendors across the world.
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
It’s important to note a dependency and possible limitation of HTTP: it is bound to TCP/IP. Indeed, all identifiers are URLs: Uniform Resource Locators. In URLs, the first segment is reserved for the domain, either an IP address or a domain name translatable to an IP address. Compare this with the more general URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), which do not have this requirement. Though we’ll often be tied to HTTP in REST, you’ll see the literature attempting, at least, to be more generic. There are definitely use cases for non-HTTP, and even non-TCP/IP addressing schemes. In Prudence, you’ll see that it’s possible to address internal resources with URIs <i>that are not URLs</i>; see <u>document.internal (page <a class="Reference" href="#../manual/api/|document-internal">1↓</a>)</u>. 
</blockquote>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-14"></a>It’s All About Infrastructure
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The most important lesson to take is the importance of infrastructure, something easily forgotten when planning architecture in ideal, abstract terms. This is why, I believe, Roy Fielding named <a class="URL" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">Chapter 5 of his 2000 dissertation</a> ‘‘Representational State Transfer (REST)’’ rather than, say, ‘‘resource-oriented architecture,’’ as we have here. Fielding, one of the authors of the HTTP protocol, was intimately familiar with its challenges, and the name ‘‘REST’’ is intended to point out the key characteristic of its infrastructure: HTTP and similar protocols are designed for transfering lightly annotated data representations. ‘‘Resources’’ are merely logical encapsulations of these representations, depending on a contract between client and server. The infrastructure does not, in itself, do anything in particular to maintain, say, a sensible hierarchy of addresses, the atomicity of CRUD operations, etc. That’s up to your implementation. But, representational state transfer—REST—is the mundane, underlying magic that makes it all possible.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
To come back to where we started: a resource-oriented architecture requires a REST infrastructure. Practically, the two terms become interchangeable.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The principles of resource-orientation can and are applied in many systems. The word wide web, of course, with its ecology of web browsers, web servers, certificate authorities, etc., is the most obvious model. But other core Internet systems, such as email (SMTP, POP, IMAP), file transfer (FTP, WebDAV) also implement some subset of REST. Your application can do this, too, and enjoy the same potential for scalability as these global, open implementations. 
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-15"></a>Does REST Scale?
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Part of the buzz about REST is that it’s an inherently scalable architecture. This is true, but perhaps not in the way that you think.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Consider that there are two uses of the word ‘‘scalable’’:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
First, it’s <b>the ability to respond to a growing number of user requests without degradation in response time</b>, by ‘‘simply’’ adding hardware (horizontal scaling) or replacing it with more powerful hardware (vertical scaling). This is the aspect of scalability that engineers care about. The simple answer is that REST can help, but it doesn’t stand out. SOAP, for example, can also do it pretty well. REST aficionados sometimes point out that REST is ‘‘stateless,’’ or ‘‘session-less,’’ both characteristics that would definitely help scale. But, this is misleading. Protocols might be stateless, but architectures built on top of them don’t have to be. For example, we’ve specifically talked about sessions here, and many web frameworks manage sessions via cookies. Likewise, you can easily make poorly scalable REST. The bottom line is that there’s nothing in REST that guarantees scalability in <i>this</i> respect. Indeed, engineers coming to REST due to this false lure end up wondering what the big deal is.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The second use of ‘‘scalability’’ comes from the realm of enterprise and project management. It’s <b>the ability of your project to grow in complexity without degradation in your ability to manage it</b>. And that’s REST’s beauty—you already have the infrastructure, which is the hardest thing to scale in a project. You don’t need to deploy client stacks. You don’t need to create and update proxy objects for five different programming languages used in your enterprise. You don’t need to deploy incompatible middleware by three different vendors and spend weeks trying to force them to play well together. Why would engineers care about REST? Precisely because they don’t have to: they can focus on application engineering, rather than get bogged down by infrastructure management.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
That said, a ‘‘resource-oriented architecture’’ as we defined here is not a bad start for (engineering-wise) scalable systems. Keep your extras lightweight, minimize or eliminate shared state, and encapsulate your resources according to use cases, and you won’t, at least, create any immediate obstacles to scaling.

You’ll find it easy, fun, and powerful enough for you to create large-scale applications that take full advantage of the inherently scalable infrastructure of REST. Happy RESTing!

<div class="Unindented">
<a class="URL" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> is a powerful object-oriented language with many high-quality core and 3rd party libraries. It has already proven itself as a capable web programming language, and has many excellent web platforms that make good use of its strengths.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Python presents a unique challenge in a scriptlet environment, due to its <u>reliance on indentation (page <a class="Reference" href="#../generating-html/|python">1↓</a>)</u>. However, because HTML is loose with whitespace, it’s possible to force the whole file to adhere to Python’s scheme. In fact, as many Python enthusiasts would argue, forcing your code to adhere to Python’s indentation requirements can go a long way towards making it more readable and manageable.

<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-18"></a>Ruby (Delectable!)
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
<a class="URL" href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> can do most of what Python can do and more. A true chameleon, it can adapt to many styles of code and programming. If something can be possible, Ruby allows it and supports it. Unlike Python, it has a very loose and forgiving syntax, which is perfect for scriptlets.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ruby’s <a class="URL" href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> platform has revolutionized web programming by offering elegant, powerful alternatives to working directly with HTTP. We hope Ruby web programmers will find in Prudence a refreshing alternative to Rails: elegantly embracing HTTP, instead of avoiding it.

If you’re serious about multithreading, <a class="URL" href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> is the way to go. Though new, Clojure is based on one of the oldest programming languages around, and enjoys a long, rich tradition of elegant solutions for tough programming challenges.

<div class="Unindented">
<a class="URL" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> (a dialect of <a class="URL" href="http://www.ecmascript.org/">ECMAScript</a>) is a sensible choice for ‘‘AJAX’’ and other rich web client applications, because it’s the same language used by web browsers and other client platforms. Web developers are already proficient in JavaScript, and can quickly be brought on board to a server-side project. Couple it with <a class="URL" href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> and JSON-based document databases, and you’re on solid, consistent ground for rapid development. Of all the web programming languages, it’s the one most widely deployed and with the most secure future.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
It’s also an under-appreciated language, and the target of undeserved scorn. Though not as feature-rich as Python or Ruby, JavaScript is still very powerful. Its straightforward closure/prototype mechanisms allow it to support object-orientation, namespaces and other paradigms. Unfortunately, client environments have proven painfully fickle: working with the browser DOM and testing with cross-browser HTML rendering quirks are painful—but these are the not the fault of the language itself. They are also not relevant to server-side development with Prudence. If you’ve been burned by JavaScript on the client, try it on the server via Prudence: you might be pleasantly surprised.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
JavaScript does not have its own core libraries, making it the most minimal Prudence flavor. Instead, it relies on the excellent JVM core.

Prudence allows a smooth transition from traditional PHP HTML generation to REST resources. It supports PHP ‘‘superglobals’’ such as $_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE and $_FILE (but not $_SESSION) to make you feel right at home. It also adds many new features to conventional HTML generation: fine-grained caching, high-performance templating languages, and more.

For this tutorial, we’ll use the savory JavaScript flavor, under the assumption that JavaScript would be the most widely known. But, let’s be clear: the JavaScript in Prudence runs on the <i>server</i>, not in the <i>browser</i>. Wrap your head around that for a minute… JavaScript is here used <i>not </i>for live manipulation of HTML elements, but to do the usual server-side work: communicating with data stores, rendering HTML pages to send to clients, etc. Of course, in your project, you might be writing JavaScript code to run on the <i>client</i>, too. We’ll even show you an example of it in this tutorial.

Now, let’s create our first web page. Create ‘‘/applications/wackywiki/web/’’, and then ‘‘/applications/wackywiki/web/static/’’. By ‘‘static’’ here is meant that the contents do not change per user request.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-6"></a>Caching
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Look at how Firefox communicates with your dynamic page using Firebug: the contents are compressed, but there is no conditional HTTP. That’s because Prudence generates a new version of the page per every user request. Since each such version might be different from the last, the default behavior is that client’s should never expect their cached version to be correct.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We can change this by adding caching to our page, specifically for 10 seconds (10,000 milliseconds):
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Hello, world! Welcome to Wacky Wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;%
document.cacheDuration = 10000
var entry = {title: ’I Love Prudence’, contents: ’This is a love letter to Prudence.’}
%&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;&lt;%= entry.title %&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;%= entry.contents %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Keep refreshing the page, and you’ll see that for every 10 seconds you are getting 304 status codes.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Actually, something far more important is happening: any browser from any computer would see the same version of the page for those 10 seconds. Prudence caches and serves a static version of the page during that interval<i> and does not run any of your JavaScript code</i>. We’ve effectively throttled execution of our code.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Our code didn’t do much in this example, but what if it were fetching data for that wiki page from a database? Caching would allow us to serve a very large number of user requests without ever touching the database. We could very precisely state that we want the database accessed only, at the most, every 10 seconds. That’s excellent scalability, easily accomplished.

</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
As your application grows, you’ll likely have a lot of reusable code. Prudence can help you manage it.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Let’s create a /web/fragments/ directory, and put the following files in it. Here’s ‘‘header.html’’:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
	&lt;title&gt;Wacky Wiki&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
	&lt;h1&gt;Wacky Wiki&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Here’s ‘‘footer.html’’:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
And here’s ‘‘entry.html’’:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;%= entry.title %&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;%= entry.contents %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We can now edit our original ‘‘/web/dynamic/index.html’’ using special ‘‘&lt;%&amp; … %&gt;’’ include scriptlets:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;%&amp; ’header/’ %&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, world! Welcome to Wacky Wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;%
document.cacheDuration = 10000
var entry = {
	title: ’I Love Prudence’,
	contents: ’This is a love letter to Prudence (fragmented).’}
%&gt;
&lt;%&amp; ’entry/’ %&gt;
&lt;%&amp; ’footer/’ %&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We can use the same fragments in other pages, too. Let’s create ‘‘/web/dynamic/home.html’’:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;%&amp; ’header/’ %&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the home wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;%
document.cacheDuration = 10000
var entry = {
	title: ’Wiki Home’,
	contents: ’This wiki page is empty.’}
%&gt;
&lt;%&amp; ’entry/’ %&gt;
&lt;%&amp; ’footer/’ %&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Note that this page is available under the URL <a class="URL" href="http://localhost:8080/wackywiki/home/">http://localhost:8080/wackywiki/home/</a>. Prudence by default ignores filename extensions for URLs and requires trailing slashes, leading to prettier, more coherent URLs for users.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-9"></a>Caching Fragments
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Fragments help organize your code, but they also offer another advantage: because Prudence caches each fragment individually, you can have certain parts of your pages cached longer than others. Moreover, you can alter the cache key to make sure that you are not caching different versions of the fragments per URL. This is a more advanced topic, but we’ll provide a quick preview of it example below for our ‘‘header’’ and ‘‘footer’’ fragments. The cache key pattern we will use ensures that the fragment is cached just once per application name (‘‘{an}’’) and document name (‘‘{dn}’’). This is appropriate for our case, because ‘‘index.html’’ and ‘‘home.html’’ never change their content for whatever Wacky Wiki page they’re in. If they did change, we could leave the cache pattern at its default, or otherwise tweak it. Maximum efficiency here for maximum scalability.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
So, here’s the new ‘‘header.html’’:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
	&lt;title&gt;Wacky Wiki&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;%
document.cacheDuration = 300000
document.cacheKeyPattern = ’{an}|{dn}’
%&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
And ‘‘footer.html’’:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;%
document.cacheDuration = 300000
document.cacheKeyPattern = ’{an}|{dn}’
%&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You won’t see any significant difference in your application’s behavior with your single browser, but for heavy fragments in large production applications serving many thousands of concurrent users the savings can be dramatic.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-10"></a>Libraries
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Prudence further helps reusability by easily allowing code libraries. Libraries are source code files with functions, classes, etc., that you’ll want to reuse in your scriptlets and in other Prudence code.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Let’s create an ‘‘/applications/wackywiki/libraries/’’ directory, and put ‘‘wikidata.js’’ in it:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">function getWikiEntry(id) {
	// (Note the forced conversion to JavaScript string)
	switch(String(id)) {
		case ’index’:
			return {
				title: ’I Love Prudence’,
				contents: ’This is a love letter to Prudence (from the database).’}
		case ’home’:
			return {
				title: ’Wiki Home’,
				contents: ’This wiki page is empty (from the database).’}
		case ’todo’:
			return {
				title: ’Things to Do’,
				contents: ’Nothing to do right now (from the database).’}
		default:
			return {
				title: ’’,
				contents: ’’}
	}
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
(This is just a silly example: in a real application, you’ll probably be fetching your wiki entries from a data store. )
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Here is our new ‘‘index.html’’ page:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;%&amp; ’header/’ %&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, world! Welcome to Wacky Wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;%
document.execute(’wikidata/’)
var entry = getWikiEntry(’index’)
%&gt;
&lt;%&amp; ’entry/’ %&gt;
&lt;%&amp; ’footer/’ %&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We’ll leave it as an exercize to you to make similar changes to ‘‘home.html’’.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Note the use of ‘‘document.execute’’ here: this is a Prudence API that lets you run code from /libraries/. We’re using it here because the JavaScript language doesn’t have it’s own include facility. However, if you’re using Prudence for Python, Ruby, PHP or Clojure, you can use those language’s natural inclusion facilities: ‘‘import’’, ‘‘require’’, etc. The /libraries/ directory is automatically added to your inclusion path. Note that Groovy has the same limitation as JavaScript in this respect, so just use ‘‘document.execute’’ there.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-27"></a>Hello, Captured World
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Creating a file per URL can only take you so far. For example, in our Wacky Wiki we had ‘‘index.html’’ and ‘‘home.html’’, but we wouldn’t want to create a file per wiki entry. What if we had a million entries?
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The pages are generic enough that they could be generated by the same code. And so, Prudence has a feature called ‘‘capturing’’ that lets you use one file to handle many URLs: we can ‘‘capture’’ URLs that fit a generic URL pattern into a single file.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Let’s capture our wiki URLs! First, let’s create the generic page, ‘‘/web/dynamic/wiki.html’’:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;%&amp; ’header/’ %&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, world! Welcome to Wacky Wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;%
document.execute(’wikidata/’)
var entryID = conversation.locals.get(’entryid’)
var entry = getWikiEntry(entryID)
%&gt;
&lt;%&amp; ’entry/’ %&gt;
&lt;%&amp; ’footer/’ %&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You see that we’re expecting the ‘‘conversation locals’’ to contain the actual entry ID. This will be supplied by Prudence’s capturing.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now, let’s capture by creating ‘‘/applications/wackywiki/routing.js’’ in our application’s root directory:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">document.execute(’defaults/application/routing/’)
router.capture(’wiki/{entryid}/’, ’wiki/’)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Note that you have to restart Prudence in order for your routing.js to take effect. Then, try to access <a class="URL" href="http://localhost:8080/wackywiki/wiki/home/">http://localhost:8080/wackywiki/wiki/home/</a>, <a class="URL" href="http://localhost:8080/wackywiki/wiki/index/">http://localhost:8080/wackywiki/wiki/index/</a> and <a class="URL" href="http://localhost:8080/wackywiki/wiki/todo/">http://localhost:8080/wackywiki/wiki/todo/</a>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We are capturing all URLs in the form of ‘‘wiki/…/’’ into ‘/web/dynamic/wiki.html’’, where the ellipsis could be any URL segment. We send all these URLs to one file, internally named ‘‘wiki/’’. (It’s actually our ‘‘wiki.html’’ from above: remember, Prudence always ignores filename extensions and requires a trailing slash.) That URL segment is also captured by Prudence and sent as a special conversation local value named ‘‘entryid’’.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We can also edit our ‘‘index.html’’ to be a simple stub to display the ‘‘index’’ wiki page:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">

conversation.locals.put(’entryid’, ’index’)

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-13"></a>Introduction: What’s REST?
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Prudence is designed from the ground up around REST (‘‘Representational State Transfer’’) principles, a term coined by Roy Fielding in <a class="URL" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">Chapter 5 of his 2000 dissertation</a>. Fielding’s analysis perceptively identified the key features of the Internet infrastructure that have made the World Wide Web and email protocols scale so well horizontally. His conclusions have helped us make better use of available technology, and have generally inspired more practical approaches to the problem of sharing state in diverse, distributed environments.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In <u>‘‘The Case for REST’’ (page <a class="Reference" href="#../../rest/">1↑</a>)</u>, we show how REST suggests a ‘‘resource-oriented architecture.’’ The ‘‘resource’’ is the <i>thing</i> that lies behind the Internet URL. REST resources you are already familiar with include HTML pages, images, videos—everything we see in the World Wide Web. But resources can also be thought of more logically as blog entries, social networking profiles, inventory items in a store or warehouse, etc. Moreover, you should think about resources as single things with multiple representations. An HTML web page might be one representation, but we can represent the same resources in any format, whether it’s meant for direct human consumption, such as PDF or plain text, or a format that can be consumed by software, such as XML, JSON and proprietary binary formats.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The ubiquitous HTTP supports sophisticated negotiation of representational formats between the client and the server, and also multiple operations on resources: in addition to GET and POST, which are commonly used in HTML forms, you can also PUT new resources where none were before and DELETE existing resources. This makes HTTP an attractive protocol for distributed applications—and, of course, it’s already there, deployed and ready for you to build upon.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-14"></a>Your First Resource
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
In Prudence, creating a RESTful resource is as easy as creating a dynamic web page.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Create an ‘‘/applications/wackywiki/resources/’’ directory to host your resources. Then, create an ‘‘entry.js’’ file in it:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">function handleInit(conversation) {
	conversation.addMediaTypeByName(’text/plain’)
}
​
function handleGet(conversation) {
	return ’Hello, REST of the World!’
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The ‘‘media type’’ mentioned in the code is just an abstract way to refer to MIME types, which are a standard way to name representation formats in the Internet. (Actually, they were originally used to identify the format of email attachments.)
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Point your browser to <a class="URL" href="http://localhost:8080/wackywiki/entry/">http://localhost:8080/wackywiki/entry/</a> to see your first resource. Not very interesting, is it? Let’s add support for another representation format:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">function handleInit(conversation) {
	conversation.addMediaTypeByName(’text/plain’)
	conversation.addMediaTypeByName(’text/html’)
}
​
function handleGet(conversation) {
	if(conversation.mediaTypeName == ’text/html’) {
		return ’&lt;html&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello, &lt;i&gt;REST&lt;/i&gt; of the World!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/html&gt;’
	}
	return ’Hello, REST of the World!’
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Refresh you browser, and now you should see your resource represented as snazzy HTML. Because desktop web browsers announce, in their HTTP requests, that they <i>prefer </i>HTML, and Prudence properly negotiated the correct format from among those we stated in our handleInit function, we could give the client what it wanted.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-15"></a>You First <i>Real </i>Resource
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
OK, enough saying hello to the world! Let’s create a resource that actually does something useful in Wacky Wiki. We’re assuming here that you created the ‘‘/libraries/wikidata.js’’ we introduced previously. Here’s our new ‘‘entry.js’’:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">document.execute(’wikidata/’)
​
function handleInit(conversation) {
	conversation.addMediaTypeByName(’text/plain’)
	conversation.addMediaTypeByName(’text/html’)
	conversation.addMediaTypeByName(’application/json’)
}
​
function handleGet(conversation) {
	var entryID = conversation.locals.get(’entryid’)
	var entry = getWikiEntry(entryID)
	switch(String(conversation.mediaTypeName)) {
		case ’application/json’:
			return ’{"title":"’ + entry.title + ’", "contents":"’ + entry.contents + ’"}’
		case ’text/html’:
			return ’&lt;html&gt;&lt;h1&gt;’ + entry.title + ’&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;’ + entry.contents + ’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;’
		default:
			return entry.title + ’\n’ + entry.contents
	}
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For this to work for all wiki entry URLs, we also have to ‘‘capture’’ them, using the method we learned above. Here’s our updated ‘‘routing.js’’:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">document.execute(’defaults/application/routing/’)
router.capture(’entry/{entryid}/’, ’entry/’)
router.capture(’wiki/{entryid}/’, ’wiki/’)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You need to restart Prudence for this new routing.js to take effect. Then, you’ll be able to see HTML representations of your wiki entries at <a class="URL" href="http://localhost:8080/wackywiki/entry/index/">http://localhost:8080/wackywiki/entry/index/</a>, <a class="URL" href="http://localhost:8080/wackywiki/entry/home/">http://localhost:8080/wackywiki/entry/home/</a> and <a class="URL" href="http://localhost:8080/wackywiki/entry/todo/">http://localhost:8080/wackywiki/entry/todo/</a>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
But, what about those JSON representations? We’ll get to them in the next section.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-16"></a>‘‘AJAX’’
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Modern web browsers are more than consumers of HTML, images and other formats available via plugins (PDF, Flash, etc.). With their internal JavaScript engines, the are adequate RESTful clients. We’ll use that feature to access our resource.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Accessing RESTful resources from within web browsers is sometimes called AJAX, which stands for ‘‘Active JavaScript and XML.’’ In this example, we’re preferring the more compact <a class="URL" href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> format over XML, so perhaps we should call it ‘‘AJAJ’’? Well, the end result is the same.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you’ve ever worked with JavaScript in web browsers, you know how painful it is to write code that runs well on all major web browsers. For this example, we’ll avoid that pain by using the cross-browser <a class="URL" href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> library, which is freely hosted by <a class="URL" href="http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/">Google</a>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Let’s add some AJAX magic to our ‘‘index.html’’:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
	&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Enter wiki page name:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="entryid"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;button id="fetch"&gt;Fetch!&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="title"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;p id="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
$(document).ready(function() {
	$(’#fetch’).click(function() {
		$.ajax({
			type: ’GET’,
			url: ’entry/’ + $(’#entryid’).val() + ’/’,
			dataType: ’json’,
			success: function(entry) {
				$(’#title’).text(entry.title);
				$(’#content’).text(entry.contents);
			}
		});
	});
});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We currently support three entry names: ‘‘index’’, ‘‘home’’ and ‘‘todo’’. Type any of them into the input box, and click ‘‘Fetch!’’. You should see the results displayed in your browser. Make sure to use Firebug to see the browser communicating with your resource.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This little example might not seem too exciting, but think of what’s going on here: Prudence is giving the web browser ‘‘raw’’ data, which it can then represent in sophisticated ways. The burden of rendering the user interface has moved from the server to the client, allowing for an improved user experience on modern browsers, and more room for your server to scale.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
But there’s a lot more to REST than AJAX: clients for your raw JSON data can be full-blown desktop applications, mobile phone apps, and even other servers on the network (perhaps also powered by Prudence). Taken together, your resources can be considered an API. In fact, a rich, RESTful API can be a valuable Internet product in itself. You can do great things without serving a single web page.
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
We’ll repeat it, because it does get confusing: In the code segment above, the JavaScript is running <i>in your browser</i>, while in all the previous examples we had JavaScript running <i>in Prudence</i>. The language is the same, but the programming environment is vastly different. In the browser, you have access to the DOM and browser services. In Prudence, you have the <u>Prudence API (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/">1↓</a>)</u> as well everything in the JVM. We think it’s nice to be able to write your web application in a single language, whether it’s on the client or the server, but if you find it confusing, go ahead and use any of the other Prudence flavors: Python, Ruby, PHP, Clojure or Groovy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="Quote">
P.S. You may have noticed that we’ve used semicolons at the end of statements on our client code. Semicolons are optional in the JavaScript language, but many experts recommend you use them anyway <i>in web browsers</i>, because many code analysis and compression tools expect them. Since there’s no need to compress your server-side code, we recommend you follow your own preference there. We happen to prefer no semicolons.

<div class="Unindented">
Though we won’t cover it in this tutorial, with Prudence—and HTTP, and AJAX—you can also accept data from the client into your resource. Use handlePut to create entirely new resources at the URL identified by the client. For example, Wacky Wiki clients can send you JSON data via a PUT, which you can then parse and save in the database as a new wiki entry. There’s also handlePost, used to update existing resources, and handleDelete for getting rid of them.

</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
In Prudence, most instance and application configuration files are written in programming language code, rather than XML or other configuration formats. This method is sometimes called ‘‘bootstrapping’’ or just ‘‘scripting.’’ So, rather than referring to them as ‘‘configuration files,’’ we’ll call them ‘‘configuration scripts.’’
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Scripting is powerful. It lets your configuration be dynamic, such that the same configuration script might configure things differently depending on the actual deployment environment and runtime circumstances. For example, you can deploy the same instance to a development environment, in which case your instance would start various debugging processes and logs, and a production environment, in which case it would optimize for performance and scale. You can even have different optimizations for different deployments. For example, a weak cloud-based instance with a single virtual CPU could be use a different HTTP engine from a dedicated box with 8 cores and a lot of RAM. With scripts, you can dynamically test for the presence of installed optional components, etc.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
But you can do more with configuration scripts: anything, in fact, that the language and its libraries allow you. You can start external services, log startup errors, notify monitoring daemons, etc.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Prudence’s configuration scripts are designed to fall back on default scripts, which are all in the /defaults/ subdirectory. These idea is for these scripts to handle configuration sensibly, as would be appropriate, or good enough, for most common use cases. You can do a lot with Prudence without changing any of these default scripts!
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The common way to override any default script is to create your own version, execute the default script first, and then apply your overrides. You can also <i>not </i>execute the default script, and instead handle things your own way. You can edit the defaults directly to apply changes across the board: they are all simple, straightforward scripts.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The disadvantage of configuration by script is more limited portability. For example, if you write your configuration scripts in Ruby, they will not work in Prudence for Python—<i>unless</i> you manually install Python support. If you want to support all Prudence flavors, you would have to include scripts for all languages.
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
Another disadvantage, for now, is that you will need to restart the Prudence instance for changes in your configuration scripts to take effect. This is true for Prudence 1.0: we plan to support ‘‘hot’’ configuration in a future version of Prudence.
</blockquote>
<div class="Unindented">
For the purposes of this manual, we’ll use the ‘‘filename.*’’ for configuration script names. To get the actual script file name, replace the ‘‘*’’ with the filename extension appropriate for your Prudence flavor: ‘‘js’’ for JavaScript, ‘‘rb’’ for Ruby, ‘‘py’’ for Python, etc.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-29"></a>/defaults/
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Here you’ll find the default scripts used in /instance/ and /applications/. Generally, you won’t want to edit the /defaults/ scripts directly, but instead override them there. Prudence tries to make configuration easy by implementing sensible default behavior with a straightforward override mechanism: simply execute the /defaults/ script and then apply your own code. It’s always a good idea to at least look at the code in the /defaults/ scripts so you can precisely understand what you’re overriding.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Here’s an overriding example in the JavaScript flavor. We’ll override the default cache installed in the component by creating a ‘‘/instance/component.js’’ script:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">// Implement defaults
document.execute(’defaults/instance/component/’)
​
// Replace default cache with a Hazelcast-based cache
importClass(com.threecrickets.prudence.cache.HazelcastCache)

	new HazelcastCache())

Virtual hosting allows you to serve multiple web sites from a single component. You can configure individual applications to attach one or more hosts, and to have different base URLs on each of these hosts. Prudence allows you to create virtual hosts for multiple domain names and HTTP ports, using simple expressions and wildcards. See <u>virtual hosts (page <a class="Reference" href="#../routing/|virtual-hosts">1↓</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
By default, an ‘‘allHosts’’ virtual host is created, and set as the component’s default host, which in turn all applications attach to by default. ‘‘allHosts’’ accepts all incoming requests, to any domain name, to any port.

Override this script to create additional virtual hosts for your component, and to change the default host.

Servers do the low-level work of listening to a port, accepting requests, and returning responses according to supported protocols. Prudence currently supports your choice among various HTTP server technologies: <a class="URL" href="http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/">Jetty</a>, <a class="URL" href="https://grizzly.dev.java.net/">Grizzly</a>, <a class="URL" href="http://www.jboss.org/netty">Netty</a> and an ‘‘internal’’ connector.

</div>
<div class="Indented">
You can create as many servers as you need to listen on multiple ports. Remember that routing is actually handled by virtual hosts, not the servers. So, if you have servers on ports 8081, 8082, and 8083, and your applications all attach to ‘‘allHosts,’’ then the applications will be available on all ports. To limit applications to specific ports, you will need to create additional virtual hosts. See <u>virtual hosts (page <a class="Reference" href="#../routing/|virtual-hosts">1↓</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Override this script to change the default port (8080) or add additional servers on other ports.

<div class="Unindented">
If you are using a <u>load balancer or another kind of proxy (page <a class="Reference" href="#../http-proxy/">1↓</a>)</u>, it makes more sense to handle secure connections there. See the example there on how to do this with Perlbal.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Note, though, that if you want to handle secure requests differently in Prudence, you must allow for some way to distinguish them. This can easily be done by creating a separate non-secure server to which the proxy would send secure requests. You can then use <u>virtual hosts (page <a class="Reference" href="#../routing/|virtual-hosts">1↓</a>)</u> or other kinds of routing to send requests to different applications or resources. Alternatively, you could check for the <u>reference (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-reference">1↓</a>)</u> in code. For example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">if(conversation.reference.schemeProtocol.name == ’HTTPS’) {
	...
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Prudence can also handle secure connections itself. Here’s an example /instance/severs.js:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">// Implement defaults
document.execute(’defaults/instance/servers/’)
​
// Create secure server listening on the default HTTPS port (443)

​
// Configure it to use our security keys
secureServer.context.parameters.add(’keystorePath’, ’/path/prudence.jks’)
secureServer.context.parameters.add(’keystorePassword’, ’mykeystorepassword’)
//secureServer.context.parameters.add(’keyPassword’, ’mykeypassword’)
​
// Add support for the X-FORWARDED-FOR header used by proxies
secureServer.context.parameters.add(’useForwardedForHeader’, ’true’)

<div class="Indented">
See the <a class="URL" href="http://www.restlet.org/documentation/2.0/jse/ext/index.html?org/restlet/ext/jetty/HttpsServerHelper.html">Restlet Jetty HttpServerHelper documentation</a> for more configuration parameters.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The above configuration script assumes the you have a JKS (‘‘Java keystore’’) file at ‘‘/path/prudence.jks’’ with your security keys. You can create one with the ‘‘keytool’’ command that is bundled with most JVMs. For example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">keytool -keystore /path/prudence.jks -alias mykey -genkey -keyalg RSA
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
When creating the keystore, you will be asked provide a password for it, and you may optionally provide a different password for your key, in which case you need to comment out the relevant line in the servers.js above. (The key alias and key password would be kept if you move the key to a different keystore.)
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Such self-created keys may be useful for controlled intranet environments, in which you can provide clients with the public key, but for Internet applications you will likely want a key created by one of the ‘‘certificate authorities’’ trusted by major browsers. Some of these certificate authorities may let your get your key in JKS format. Otherwise, if they support PKCS12 format, you can use keytool (from version 6) to convert it to JKS. For example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">keytool -importkeystore -srcstoretype PKCS12 -srckeystore /path/prudence.pkcs12 -destkeystore /path/prudence.jks
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you don’t even have access to a PKCS12 file, you can create one from your ‘‘.key’’ and ‘‘.crt’’ (or ‘‘.pem’’) files using <a class="URL" href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

Note that URLs in the virtual host may overlap as far as hierarchy is concerned.

</div>
<ul>

<li>
0: Disabled. Client caching headers are not sent.
</li>
<li>
1: Conditional (the default). The client is asked to use conditional mode HTTP to verify that the cache has not changed, via the modificationDate and expirationDate headers. This is a good default, because it generally offers most of the advantages of caching with no risks. See <u>conditional requests for HTML generation (page <a class="Reference" href="#../generating-html/|conditional-requests">1↓</a>)</u> for a complete discussion.
</li>
<li>
2: Offline. The client is asked to cache without verification, via the maxAge header. This involves some risk: if you ask to cache a page for one week, but then find out that you have a mistake in your application, then users will not see any fix you publish until their local cache expires, which can take up to a week! It’s important that you understand the implications before using this mode.

All files under /web/dynamic/ are assumed to be text files, and are mapped to URLs using the directory and file path, but without the filename extension.

The filename’s extension will be used to map the default MIME type for the file.

<div class="Unindented">
It’s important to remember that non-scriptlet text turns into ‘‘print’’ statements in your scriptlet language: these statements can have an effect on your code blocks, such as if/then blocks, loops, try/catch, closures, etc. Careless use of scriptlets can lead to syntax errors or, worse, to unexpected behavior.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For example, this JavaScript code will generate a syntax error:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;% var x = 0 %&gt;You won’t see this text!
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The reason is that it produces the following mangled JavaScript code:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">var x = 0 print(’You won’t see this text!’)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Another example can show possibly unexpected results:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;% for(var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) %&gt;This line appears 10 times&lt;br&gt;
And so does this line!&lt;br&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you expect the first line to appear 10 times and second line to appear once, you are wrong. The reason is that the newline is part of the ‘‘print’’, not part of your scriptlet code. It produces this JavaScript code:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">for(var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) print(’This line appears 10 times&lt;br&gt;\nAnd so does this line!&lt;br&gt;’)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Two methods to avoid this problem are:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
Always put newlines in the beginning and end of your scriptlets, so that it’s clear at a glance where statements begin and end:
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;%
var x = 0
%&gt;
You WILL see this text!
</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>
Alternatively, you can explicitly put end-of-statement marks, if your language supports them. For example:
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;% var x = 0; %&gt;
You WILL see this text!
</pre>
</div>
</li>

<div class="Unindented">
Python represents a special challenge in a scriptlet environment due to its reliance on significant whitespace for blocks. This means taking special care in mixing scriptlets with text. For example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;%
for x in range(0,10):
  %&gt;
This line appears 10 times&lt;br&gt;
&lt;%
%&gt;
But this line appears once&lt;br&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You’ll notice that we put the end delimiter of the first scriptlet after an indentation. This tells Python that whatever follows (the ‘‘print’’ statement for the non-scriptlet text) will be in that for loop. We then used a scriptlet with only a newline to end the for loop.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A more complex example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;%
for x in range(0,10):
  for y in range(0,2):
    %&gt;
This line appears 20 times&lt;br&gt;
&lt;%

This appears every third line&lt;br&gt;
&lt;%
%&gt;
But this line appears once&lt;br&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The trick here was using a scriptlet with an indentation to end the inner for loop, while keeping us in the outer for loop.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Tricky indeed, and definitely not easy to decipher at a glance. It may make more sense to use Python’s ‘‘print’’ statement in such situations:

for x in range(0,10):

<div class="Unindented">
A common idiom is to print out expressions interwoven with non-scriptlet text. The expression scriptlet, marked by an equal sign, can help you reduce clutter. It’s equivalent to a simple ‘‘print’’ of the expression. For example, the above example could be shortened into:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;% for(var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { %&gt;

Expression can be as elaborate as needed. For example, let’s show line numbers above 5 in bold:

<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">This is line number &lt;%= i&gt;5 ? ’&lt;b&gt;’ + i + ’&lt;/b&gt;’ : i %&gt; out of 10.&lt;br/&gt;

<div class="Indented">
Just like an <u>expression scriptlet (page <a class="Reference" href="#../generating-html/|expression-scriptlets">1↑</a>)</u> is equivalent to a ‘‘print’’, an include scriptlet is equivalent to calling <u>document.include (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|document-include">1↓</a>)</u>.

Separating code into separate files that are then included is a very important technique for two reasons:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
It makes your application far more manageable by allowing you to reuse code blocks. A common use case is to have special ‘‘header.html’’ and ‘‘footer.html’’ files included by all pages in the application.
</li>
<li>
In Prudence, each document has its own caching characteristics, allowing you to create elaborate caching schemes by splitting a file into smaller files. See <u>caching (page <a class="Reference" href="#../generating-html/|caching">1↓</a>)</u> and <u>‘‘Scaling Tips’’ (page <a class="Reference" href="#../../scaling/|caching">1↓</a>)</u>.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-41"></a>/web/fragments/

<div class="Unindented">
In the example above, our ‘‘/web/dynamic/lines/simple.html’’ file would be exposed via a URL. However, we do not intend this file to served in itself, only as a file to be included in other files.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
To avoid external exposure, put files in /web/framents/ instead of /web/dynamic/. Use is otherwise identical. For example, we’d move our file above to ‘‘/web/fragments/lines/simple.html’’. Files in /web/fragments/ are only available via include scriptlets.

An alternative to using /web/fragments/ is explicit <u>URI hiding (page <a class="Reference" href="#../routing/|hiding">1↓</a>)</u>.

By default, Prudence will assume your scriptlets to be in the source code of your Prudence flavor. For example, scriptlets in Prudence for JavaScript will be assumed to be JavaScript by default.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
However, Prudence lets you use scriptlets of any language by adding the language name after the first scriptlet delimiter. For example, assuming we’re using the JavaScript flavor:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
JavaScript:&lt;br/&gt;

Note that once you ‘‘switch’’ to another language, all subsequent scriptlets will be assumed to be of that language unless you explicitly set them to something else.

Expression and include scriptlets work the same way. For example:

You might think that mixing programming languages is a bad idea in general, and only (painfully) necessary for making use of legacy code. However, it can be a <i>great</i> idea if you consider that all Prudence flavors come with two high-performance templating languages, <a class="URL" href="http://velocity.apache.org/">Velocity</a> and <a class="URL" href="http://threecrickets.com/succinct/">Succinct</a>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
By mixing languages, you can write all the more straightforward templating in a templating language, switching to full programming language scriptlets only when you need advanced features. For example, here we’ll use JavaScript to set up our data, and then use Velocity to print it out:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;%
var country = myDatabase.fetchCurrentCountry()
conversation.locals.put(’country’, country)
%&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Famous Quotes:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;%velocity
​
&lt;p&gt;The rain in $conversation.locals.country stays mainly in the plain.&lt;/p&gt;
​

Not only is the Velocity code more readable and easier to manage, but it also performs better, is less prone to errors, and more secure. Prudence lets you use the right tool for the job.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-69"></a>In-Flow Scriptlets
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
One tiny hiccup to be aware of when <u>mixing languages (page <a class="Reference" href="#../generating-html/|mixing-languages">1↑</a>)</u> is that code blocks can not trivially span several scriptlets in multiple languages. For example, this won’t immediately work:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;%javascript
for(var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
	conversation.locals.put(’i’, i)
%&gt;
&lt;%velocity
This is line $conversation.locals.i out of 10.&lt;br/&gt;
%&gt;
&lt;%javascript
}
%&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The reason is that, by necessity, Prudence runs scriptlets of different languages separately, in sequence. The language switch thus represents a syntactical boundary. The above would cause a syntax error, because we have a for-loop in the first scriptlet that isn’t closed.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
But, fear not, Prudence lets you solve this problem via the ‘‘in-flow’’ scriptlet, marked by a colon. Here’s the exact same code as above, but with the Velocity scriptlet marked with a extra colon:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;%javascript
for(var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
	conversation.locals.put(’i’, i)
%&gt;
&lt;%:velocity
This is line $conversation.locals.i out of 10.&lt;br/&gt;
%&gt;
&lt;%
}
%&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This works! But how, you might wonder? Behind the scenes, the in-flow scriptlet is run from within the enclosing language. We thus never leave the enclosing language for the purposes of running through the file. Don’t worry about performance here: in-flow scriptlets are compiled only once per file. Also, in-flow scriptlets are treated as regular scriptlets if there is no language switch, making them always safe to use if you’re not sure.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
One last note: in-flow scriptlets to not change the scriptlet language, so that we did not have to mark the closing bracked scriptlet as JavaScript.

Files and all their scriptlets are only compiled once, when they are first requested by a client. The compiled code is kept in a cache, under your Prudence /cache/ directory. From then on, each request is handled by the compiled version, which is updated only if the original file changes. This cache is maintained even if you restart Prudence.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Unless a valid cache entry exists, the compiled code is executed anew for each request, essentially like a script. This is why <u>global variables are not kept or shared between requests (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|global-variables">1↓</a>)</u>. Note that there’s some minimal setup and cleanup involved in executing the code anew. It’s very unlikely that this overhead would meaningfully affect performance, especially with caching in place, but you can avoid it if you use <u>resources, which have a more static life cycle (page <a class="Reference" href="#../resources/|life">1↓</a>)</u>, instead of /web/dynamic/ pages.
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
What if you edit the file? Prudence will automatically pick up your changes and recompile. This happens on the fly, while the application is running. Are you worried that this check would happen for every client request? You can easily control the <u>minimum time interval (page <a class="Reference" href="#../application/|dynamic-web-minimum-time-between-validity-checks">1↑</a>)</u> in which Prudence assumes the file is unchanged, and will not check the file for validity.
</div>

An updated file would also cause <u>cache entries (page <a class="Reference" href="#../generating-html/|caching">1↓</a>)</u> produced by this file to be invalidated.

You can use <u>document.addDependency (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|document-add-dependency">1↓</a>)</u> to associate your own life to that of another file. If a dependency is updated, it will force your file to be reloaded.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-39"></a>Caching<a class="Label" name="../generating-html/|caching"> </a>
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
You’ve chosen to generate HTML dynamically because you want requests to be able to have different results. However, sometimes you do not expect results, or parts of the results, to change very often. For example, a home web page might display the local temperature, but it would probably be good enough to update it every half hour, instead of per every request.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Depending on what your scriptlets are doing, dynamically generating a web page can be very costly, and could be a performance and scalability bottleneck for your application under heavy load. You don’t want to waste resources to regenerate results that have not changed.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The solution is to cache results. Sometimes caching for even tiny time intervals can make a huge different in the ability of your application to handle load. For example, let’s say that in order to fetch the current user count for our home page we need to query a database on the network. Without caching, every client request would result in a service query. Let’s say our web page gets 100 hits per second. Caching our home page for a mere 5 seconds would throttle our database queries down to 1 every 5 seconds, vs. 500 every 5 seconds without caching. And users would get a current user count to 5 seconds old. It’s a tolerable inaccuracy that generates enormous savings.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This was a trivial example. Truly scalable software requires smart caching everywhere, from the level of file and database access all the way to the generated results. For a full treatment of the topic, see <u>‘‘Scaling Tips’’ (page <a class="Reference" href="#../../scaling/|caching">1↓</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Every /web/dynamic/ and /fragment/ document has its own caching interval, <u>document.cacheDuration (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|document-cache-duration">1↓</a>)</u>, which you can access and change in scriptlets. For example, here’s the home page mentioned above:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;%
document.cacheDuration = 5 * 1000 // five seconds
var userCount = myDatabase.getCurrentUsers().count()
%&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the home page!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;%= userCount %&gt; users are currently logged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;%&amp; ’temperature/’ %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Here is ‘‘/web/fragments/temperature.html’’:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;%
document.cacheDuration = 30 * 60 * 1000 // half an hour
var temperature = weatherServer.fetchCurrentTemperature()
%&gt;
The current temperature is &lt;%= temperature %&gt; degrees.
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Any file that includes the temperature fragment will use a cached result, up to half an hour old. The home page, however, is regenerated every 5 seconds, so that the user count is up to 5 seconds old. Prudence lets you finely control how caching works.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Note that you can change the cache duration dynamically. For example, you might want to increase it if you see that your machine’s CPU load is too high, or you might even want to decrease it during ‘‘rush hours’’ where users expect to see especially up-to-date results.

The default cache key used by Prudence is sensible enough that it would not allow for cache conflicts while producing good results.

Start with the <u>document.cacheKeyPattern API (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|document-cache-key-pattern">1↓</a>)</u>, and then take a look at <u>cache key pattern handlers (page <a class="Reference" href="#../handlers/|cache-key-pattern-handlers">1↓</a>)</u>.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-43"></a>Caching and Compression<a class="Label" name="../generating-html/|caching-and-compression"> </a>
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
For further bandwidth and performance improvements with most clients, Prudence compresses your output by default, by setting <u>conversation.encoding (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-encoding">1↓</a>)</u> to the client’s preferred encoding. Modern client processors, even on mobile devices, decompress fast enough that the network ends up being the performance bottleneck. The smaller the response, then, the better.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Because the <u>cache key pattern (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|document-cache-key-pattern">1↓</a>)</u> automatically gets the encoding added to it, you will always be using the correctly encoded cache entry.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Compression does require some additional computation overhead. Note that if you are caching the output, it will be stored in the cache in its compressed state, such that subsequent cache retrievals would not involve any additional overhead. Additionally, if an uncompressed version already exists in the cache, it will be compressed, cached and used, for optmal efficiency. Thus, the total overhead would likely be insignificant for cached documents, while the bandwidth savings and performance benefits could be considerable. Caching and compression are good friends!
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If there are no gains from compression in your application, you can disable Prudence’s automatic use of the client’s preferred encoding via the ‘‘com.threecrickets.prudence.GeneratedTextResource.negotiateEncoding’’ application global.

<blockquote class="Quote">
If you’re <u>running Prudence behind a proxy (page <a class="Reference" href="#../http-proxy/">1↓</a>)</u> that already does compression, and are worried that you’re compressing twice, then stop worrying: any decent proxy will know not to compress content that’s already compressed.

HTTP clients, such as web browsers, store downloaded content in their cache, marking it with a modification date and tag according to HTTP headers in the response. Subsequent requests to the same URL will be ‘‘conditional,’’ meaning that the client will tell the server what the latest modification date it has. If the server does not have new data, then it returns an empty response with the 304 ‘‘not modified’’ HTTP status, letting the client know that it is safe to use its cached version. This saves both bandwidth and processing resources on the server.

You can disable this feature via the <u>dynamicWebClientCachingMode setting (page <a class="Reference" href="#../application/|dynamic-web-client-caching-mode">1↑</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-44"></a>Client Caching
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
Though clients rely on a local cache for conditional requests, you can provide them with additional caching directives. You can enable this via the the <u>dynamicWebClientCachingMode setting (page <a class="Reference" href="#../application/|dynamic-web-client-caching-mode">1↑</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Explicitly setting cache directives has an important side effect: most clients will <i>not</i> send conditional HTTP requests for the cached data until the cache entry expires. This allows you to save bandwidth and improves client performance, but at the expense of not being able to update the client upon changes. Use with care.

For even more control of these headers, consider using a <u>resource (page <a class="Reference" href="#../resources/|conditional-requests">1↓</a>)</u> instead.

<div class="Unindented">
Use of HTML’s &lt;form&gt; tag is going out of fashion, as more powerful JavaScript-based approaches, such as ‘‘AJAX,’’ are used instead to send data from the client to the server and to receive a response. Prudence has excellent support for ‘‘AJAX’’ via <u>resources (page <a class="Reference" href="#../resources/">1↓</a>)</u>. Nevertheless, Prudence also fully supports HTML forms, via the <u>conversation.form API (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-form">1↓</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Let’s start with a simple form:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form name="contact" method="POST"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Your message to us:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;textarea name="content" cols="50" rows="15"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;An email address for us to send you a reply:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;input name="email" type="text"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;button type="submit"&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
As it stands, the above form will simply render again when the client clicks ‘‘send.’’ Let’s add a scriptlet to support the ‘‘POST’’ case:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;% if(conversation.request.method == ’POST’) { %&gt;
Thank you for your message! You will be getting an answer to &lt;%= conversation.form.get(’email’) %&gt; soon.
&lt;% } else { %&gt;
&lt;form name="contact" method="POST"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Your message to us:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;textarea name="content" cols="50" rows="15"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;An email address for us to send you a reply:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;% } %&gt;

You might want to separate the form handler above into two fragments, one for displaying the form and the other for processing it. The main form could then include either fragment according to the value of conversation.request.method.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
However, you can also use Prudence’s <u>capturing of URI patterns (page <a class="Reference" href="#../routing/|uri-patterns">1↓</a>)</u> to automatically use either file without a main file to switch between the two. Here’s an example application routing.js:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">document.execute(’defaults/application/routing/’)
router.capture(’contact/’, ’contact/{m}/’)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We can then have two files, ‘‘contact/GET.html’’ and ‘‘contact/PUT.html’’ to handle each method for the same ‘‘contact/’’ URL.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-46"></a>Handling POST with a Resource

A hybrid solution is to direct the form to a different URL, where you use a <u>resource (page <a class="Reference" href="#../resources/">1↓</a>)</u> instead of a scriptlet to handle POST. Our example form tag would thus be:

In Prudence, ‘‘resources’’ are encapsulated operational units similar to ‘‘objects’’ in object-oriented architectures. Resources, however, have a stricter structure than objects and define a messaging system more suitable for distributed environments such as the Internet and the World Wide Web. The idea of a ‘‘resource-oriented architecture,’’ often called ‘‘REST,’’ is covered in depth in <u>‘‘The Case for REST’’ (page <a class="Reference" href="#../../rest/">1↑</a>)</u>.

<div class="Unindented">
All files under /resources/ are assumed to be source code files, and are mapped to URLs using the directory and file path, but without the filename extension. For example, the file ‘‘/resources/thread/list.js’’ would map to a URL like ‘‘http://mydomain.org/forum/thread/list/’’. You can also <u>‘‘capture’’ (page <a class="Reference" href="#../routing/|capturing">1↓</a>)</u> many URLs to be handled by a single file.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The filename’s extension will be used to determine the language of the source code.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The above is a very brief overview; see <u>routing (page <a class="Reference" href="#../routing/">1↓</a>)</u> for an in-depth explanation of how files become URLs.

<div class="Unindented">
Files are only compiled once, when they are first requested by a client. The compiled code is kept in a cache, under your Prudence /cache/ directory. From then on, each request is handled by the compiled version, which is updated only if the original file changes. This cache is maintained even if you restart Prudence.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The file itself is executed only once, like a script, upon the first request. If it executes successfully, the remaining state, which contains all the entry points and global variables, is kept in memory. From then on the entry points are invoked in that state. The file will be executed again only if it changes. Note that this runtime state is <i>not</i> cached to disk, like the compiled code, so that restarting Prudence will mean that all your resources will have to be executed before their entry points can be invoked. For this reason, <u>global variables are not kept or shared between such file updates (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|global-variables">1↓</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This, then, is the difference between ‘‘defrosting’’ and ‘‘preheating’’ for resources: the former involves making sure that code is compiled and cached, and the latter actually executes the code, and additionally invokes the <u>handleInit (page <a class="Reference" href="#../resources/|handle-init">1↓</a>)</u> and <u>handleGet (page <a class="Reference" href="#../resources/|handle-get">1↓</a>)</u> entry points.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Note that many threads might be invoking entry points concurrently: make sure you understand the concerns of concurrent programming, as detailed in <u>‘‘Managing State’’ (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|concurrency">1↓</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
What if you edit the file? Prudence will automatically pick up your changes and recompile. This happens on the fly, while the application is running. Are you worried that this check would happen for every client request? You can easily control the <u>minimum time interval (page <a class="Reference" href="#../application/|resources-minimum-time-between-validity-checks">1↑</a>)</u> in which Prudence assumes the file is unchanged, and will not check the file for validity.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You can use <u>document.addDependency (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|document-add-dependency">1↓</a>)</u> to associate your own life to that of another file. If a dependency is updated, it will force your file to be reloaded.

As is explained in <u>resource ‘‘life’’ (page <a class="Reference" href="#../resources/|life">1↑</a>)</u>, the first time your source code is loaded, at the time of the first user request, it is executed from start to finish. That means that any code outside of the entry points is run immediately.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Global source code can thus be a good place to initialize various services you need for handling requests. Just be very careful about two things:
</div>
<ul>

<li>
<u>Global variables are not kept or shared between file updates (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|global-variables">1↓</a>)</u>, which cause the file to be reloaded, recompiled, and thus re-executed. Use <u>application.globals (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|application-globals">1↓</a>)</u> instead.
</li>
<li>
The re-execution mentioned above can cause your services to be re-initialized. This can be very undesirable, because the service previously initialized may not have been released. It can even lead to errors. It’s thus a good idea to first check if the service has already been initialized. Storing references in <u>application.globals (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|application-globals">1↓</a>)</u> is a great way to keep track of this.
</li>
</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
Consider using the <u>handleInit entry point (page <a class="Reference" href="#../resources/|handle-init">1↓</a>)</u> instead of global source code for service initialization. Because handleInit is called for every request, you can make sure to check there if the services you need are up or not.
</div>

You may also want to run <u>maintenance tasks (page <a class="Reference" href="#../tasks/">1↓</a>)</u> occasionally to check for and clean up unused services.

<div class="Unindented">
Each file is a regular source code file, but a few special ‘‘entry points’’ are used by Prudence to connect user requests to your resource. All entry points except one (handleInit) are optional. We’ll document each entry point below, but first, here’s what an ‘‘entry point’’ means for each flavor of Prudence:
</div>
<ul>

<li>
Python uses global functions:
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">def handle_get(conversation):
	return ’Hello, world!’
</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>
Ruby uses global methods:
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">def handle_get conversation
	return ’Hello, world!’
end
</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>
Clojure uses functions in the current namespace:
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">(defn handle-get [conversation]
	’Hello, World!’)
</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>
JavaScript uses global functions:
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">function handleGet(conversation) {
	return ’Hello, world!’
}
</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>
PHP uses global functions:
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">function handle_get($conversation) {
	return ’Hello, World!’;
}
</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>
Groovy uses closures tied to global variables (there are no global methods in Groovy):
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">handleGet = { conversation -&gt;
	return ’Hello, World!’
}
</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
Note that the name of the entry point follows typical conventions for each language. In this documentation, we’ll use ‘‘camel case’’ (handleGet), but be sure to replace the names following the examples above.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
All entry points accept the <u>‘‘conversation’’ service (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation">1↓</a>)</u> as the sole argument. The other services (‘‘application’’, ‘‘executable’’, etc.) are available as global variables.

The main work is to initialize supported media types via <u>conversation.addMediaType (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-add-media-type">1↓</a>)</u>, in order of preference. For example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">

    conversation.addMediaTypeByName(’text/plain’)

Prudence handles content negotiation automatically, choosing the best media type according to list of acceptable and preferred formats sent by the client and this list.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-47"></a>But, Why?
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
You might wonder why we add these supported media types dynamically for each request, since they are usually always the same. The reason is that sometimes they may not be the same. In handleInit, you can check for various conditions of the conversation, or even external to the conversation, to decide which media types to support. For example, you might not want to support XHTML for old browsers, but you’d want it at the top of the list for new browsers. Or, you might not be able to support PDF in case an external service is down. In which case, you won’t want it on the list at all, in which case content negotiation would choose a different format that the client supports, such as DVI.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
So, this gives you a lot flexibility, at no real expense: adding media types per request is extremely lightweight.

<div class="Indented">
The following return types are supported:

<li>
Representation instances: You can construct and return a <a class="URL" href="http://www.restlet.org/documentation/2.0/jse/api/index.html?org/restlet/representation/Representation.html">Restlet representation</a> directly.
</li>
<li>
Other return values: If the <u>conversation.mediaType (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-media-type">1↓</a>)</u> is ‘‘application/java’’ the value will be wrapped in an <a class="URL" href="http://www.restlet.org/documentation/2.0/jse/api/index.html?org/restlet/representation/ObjectRepresentation.html">ObjectRepresentation instance</a>.

This entry point, if it exists, is called before handleGet in order to provide Prudence with information required for <u>conditional HTTP requests (page <a class="Reference" href="#../resources/|conditional-requests">1↓</a>)</u>. Only if conditions are not met—for example if our resource is newer than the version the client has cached, or the tag has changed—does Prudence continue to handleGet.

The following return types are supported:

If you implement handleGetInfo, you should be returning the same conditional information in your handleGet implementation, so that the client would know how to tag the data. The return value from handleGetInfo does not, in fact, ever get to the client: it is only used internally by Prudence to process conditional requests.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-48"></a>In the real world…

<div class="Unindented">
You might be tempted to go ahead and provide a handleGetInfo entry point for every resource you create. This is not necessarily a good practice, for three reasons:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
It could be that you don’t need this optimization. Make sure, first, that you’ve actually identified a problem with performance or scalability, and that you’ve traced it to handleGet on this resource.
</li>
<li>
It could be that you won’t gain anything from this optimization. Caches and other optimizations along the route between your data and your client might already be doing a great job at keeping handleGet as efficient as it could be. If not, improving them could offer far greater benefits overall than a handleGetInfo.
</li>
<li>
It could be that you’ll even hurt your scalability! The reason is that an efficient handleGetInfo implementation would need some mechanism in place to track of data modification, and this mechanism can introduce overhead into your system that causes it to scale worse than without your handleGetInfo.
</li>
</ol>

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-46"></a>Conditional Requests<a class="Label" name="../resources/|conditional-requests"> </a>
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
HTTP clients, such as web browsers, store downloaded content in their local cache, marking it with a modification date and tag according to HTTP headers in the response. Subsequent requests to the same URL will be ‘‘conditional,’’ meaning that the client will tell the server what the latest modification date it has. If the server does not have new data, then it returns an empty response with the 304 ‘‘not modified’’ HTTP status, letting the client know that it is safe to use its cached version. This saves both bandwidth and processing resources on the server.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
To support conditional requests, you have to explicitly set at least one of <u>conversation.modificationDate (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-modification-date">1↓</a>)</u> and <u>conversation.tag (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-tag">1↓</a>)</u>. If you implement <u>handleGetInfo (page <a class="Reference" href="#../resources/|handle-get-info">1↑</a>)</u>, you should be returning one of these values instead.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Note that these attributes are ignored in case you are constructing and returning your own <a class="URL" href="http://www.restlet.org/documentation/2.0/jse/api/index.html?org/restlet/representation/Representation.html">Representation instance</a>.

<div class="Unindented">
Though clients rely on a local cache for conditional requests, you can provide them with additional caching directives. In Prudence, you can control the expiration of the client’s cached entry with <u>conversation.maxAge (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-max-age">1↓</a>)</u> or <u>conversation.expirationDate (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-expiration-date">1↓</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Explicitly setting cache directives has an important side effect: most clients will <i>not</i> send conditional HTTP requests for the cached data until the cache entry expires. This allows you to save bandwidth and improves client performance, but at the expense of not being able to update the client upon changes. Use with care.

A ‘‘resource-oriented architecture’’ is purposely more minimal than object-oriented, transactional architectures. As discussed in <u>‘‘The Case for REST’’ (page <a class="Reference" href="#../../rest/">1↑</a>)</u>, there are many far-reaching advantages to this minimalism. While it’s possible for you to maintain multiple interfaces to your service, it might make more sense to standardize around REST principles throughout your application. A single, uniform API is more maintainable, and less prone to bugs.

<div class="Indented">
Prudence lets you access your resources internally, without having to go through HTTP, using <u>document.internal (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|document-internal">1↓</a>)</u>. You can furthermore avoid special representations and pass JVM objects through directly by setting <u>conversation.mediaType (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-media-type">1↓</a>)</u> to ‘‘application/java’’.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For example, here’s ‘‘/resources/testme.js’’ that nicely supports both external and internal clients:

<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">function handleInit(conversation) {
	conversation.addMediaTypeByName(’application/json’)
	conversation.addMediaTypeByName(’application/java’)

	}
}
​
function getData() {
	return {name: ’test’, description: ’This is some test data’}
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We can then access the resource directly, without any JSON encoding/decoding:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">var data = document.internal(’/testme/’, ’application/java’).get().object

print(data.description)

<blockquote class="Quote">
Note: The ‘‘application/java’’ media type can be used <u>externally (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|document-external">1↓</a>)</u>, too.

Prudence supports a few kinds of ‘‘handlers,’’ special purpose code for handling specified mechanisms.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-48"></a>Comparison with Resources
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Creating handlers is similar to creating a <u>resource (page <a class="Reference" href="#../resources/">1↑</a>)</u>, except that they are much simpler.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
All files under /handlers/ are assumed to be source code files. They are mapped simply to internal URIs, where a trailing slash is optional. Handlers do not have external URIs like <u>resources (page <a class="Reference" href="#../resources/|files">1↑</a>)</u>. Though there are different kinds of handlers, they are all put in /handlers/, the different being only in which entry points Prudence expects to find in them. It’s up to you to use the correct kind of handler for the correct purpose.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The life cycle of handlers is similar to that of <u>resources (page <a class="Reference" href="#../resources/|life">1↑</a>)</u>, except that no defrosting or preheating is supported.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<u>Entry points (page <a class="Reference" href="#../resources/|entry-points">1↑</a>)</u> work a bit differently:
</div>
<ul>

<li>
Like in resources, the <u>‘‘conversation’’ service (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation">1↓</a>)</u> is provided as the first argument, but only a subset of the API is supported.
</li>
<li>
Some entry points support additional arguments.

</ul>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-49"></a>Cache Key Pattern Handlers<a class="Label" name="../handlers/|cache-key-pattern-handlers"> </a>
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
These handlers are used to set <u>conversation.locals (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-locals">1↓</a>)</u> that are then used for filling in custom <u>document.cacheKeyPattern (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|document-cache-key-pattern">1↓</a>)</u> variables. If, and only if, the variable is used in a cache key pattern, then the handler is called. It is expected that the handler would then fill the appropriate <u>conversation.local (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-locals">1↓</a>)</u> with a value, which is then used to cast the pattern into a value.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Custom variables for sophisticated, powerful caching strategies. For example, by including a user identifier in cache key patterns, you can allow for caching pages or fragments per user.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-80"></a>Global Handlers
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
One way to use them is to set them globally, such they will be usable in cache key patterns of any document. To do so, in your application’s /routing.* use the cacheKeyPatternHandlers service, which is a map of variable names (without the curly brackets) to handler names. For example, let’s have ‘‘{un}’’ and ‘‘{ug}’’ be handled by ‘‘/handlers/userinfo.js’’. Here the /routing.js:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">cacheKeyPatternHandlers.put(’un’, ’userinfo/’)
cacheKeyPatternHandlers.put(’ug’, ’userinfo/’)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-81"></a>Local Handlers
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
You can also set cache key pattern handlers for specific documents, using <u>document.cacheKeyPatternHandlers (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|document-cache-key-pattern-handlers">1↓</a>)</u>. Local settings will override global settings. For example, here’s a scriptlet from a document in /web/dynamic/ or /web/fragments/:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">document.cacheKeyPatternHandlers.put(’un’, ’userinfo/’)
document.cacheKeyPatternHandlers.put(’ug’, ’userinfo/’)

<div class="Unindented">
The second argument of this entry point, after the <u>‘‘conversation’’ service (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation">1↓</a>)</u>, is a list of the variable names that appear in the <u>document.cacheKeyPattern (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|document-cache-key-pattern">1↓</a>)</u>, and which you have registered to handle by calling <u>document.cacheKeyPatternHandlers (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|document-cache-key-pattern-handlers">1↓</a>)</u>. The variable names here are not enclosed in curly brackets.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A good technique is to iterate this list and fill in an appropriate <u>conversation.local (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-locals">1↓</a>)</u> for each variable. He is a ‘‘/handlers/userinfo.js’’ to match the example above:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

		switch(variable) {

<div class="Unindented">
Tasks are straightforward scripts placed in the application’s /tasks/ subdirectory. They are straightforward in that, upon execution, the code is simply run as is. There is no particular entry point as with /resources/ or /handlers/. They can be run on-demand or scheduled to run and specific times.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Tasks are part of an application, and have access to the same ‘‘application’’, ‘‘document’’ and ‘‘executable’’ API services as other application code. Likewise, you can access any code in /libraries/ via <u>document.execute (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|document-execute">1↓</a>)</u> or via your language’s usual inclusion facility. Unlike /resources/ and /web/dynamic/ code, /tasks/ code has no <u>‘‘conversation’’ API service (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation">1↓</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Tasks run in their own global thread pool, which is separate from that of the HTTP threads. Thus, they can be considered ‘‘asynchronous’’ in regards to HTTP requests. The usual concurrency concerns apply to them.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Prudence provides two facilities for scheduling tasks:
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-51"></a>On Demand
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Use <u>application.task</u> <u>(page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|application-task">1↓</a>)</u> to spawn or schedule tasks on demand from your /resources/ or /web/dynamic/ code. You might want to store a flag in <u>application.globals (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|application-globals">1↓</a>)</u> to mark that the task has already been scheduled.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-52"></a>At Startup
</h2>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-84"></a>Startup Task
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Prudence will automatically run the task called ‘‘startup/’’ upon startup. Note that it will run after all the other startup tasks (defrosting, preheating) finish, in order to make sure your application is ‘‘hot’’ first. If you need multiple tasks running—usually repeating tasks, such as those that do general maintenance, monitor resource availability, send out email reminders, etc.—you can start them from your startup task using <u>application.task</u> <u>(page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|application-task">1↓</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For example, here is an application’s ‘‘/tasks/startup.js’’ file:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">application.logger.info(’Scheduling monitor task to repeat every second’)
application.task(’monitor/’, 1000, 1000, false)

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Here is an example default.js (note the use of ‘‘applicationService’’ instead of ‘‘application’’):
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">document.execute(’defaults/application/’)

<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-53"></a>crontab<a class="Label" name="../tasks/|crontab"> </a>
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
This facility lets you schedule tasks to run at specific (Gregorian) calendrical times. It is similar to calling <u>application.task</u> <u>(page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|application-task">1↓</a>)</u> in the application’s configuration scripts, but allows for more succint, calendrical repetition patterns.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
To use this facility, place a file with the name ‘‘crontab’’ in your application’s base subdirectory. Its format is purposely very similar to that of the crontab configuration file found in many Unix-like operating system: each line starts with scheduling pattern and ends with the task name. The scheduling pattern is a series of five whitespace-separated settings. Any of these settings can be ‘‘*’’, signifying that any value would match. Use a slash to match only numbers that divide equally by the number after the slash (can also be used on ‘‘*’’). Ranges (inclusive) are possible, separated by hyphens. Multiple settings are possible, separated by commas. Multiple patterns are possible, separated by pipes.
</div>
<ol>

<li>
Minutes of the hour, 0-59.
</li>
<li>
Hour of the day, 0-23.
</li>
<li>
Day of the month, 1-31. The special setting ‘‘L’’ signifies the last day of the month, which varies per month and year.
</li>
<li>
Month of the year, 1-12. Three-letter English month names may be used instead of numbers: ‘‘jan’’, ‘‘feb’’, ‘‘mar’’, etc.
</li>
<li>
Day of the week, 0-6. Three-letter English day names may be used instead of numbers: ‘‘sun’’, ‘‘mon’’, ‘‘tue’’, etc.

</li>

<div class="Unindented">
Notes:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
‘‘crontab’’ will be checked for changes and parsed once per minute. This means that you can edit this file and have your task scheduling change on the fly without restarting Prudence.
</li>
<li>
You can schedule the same task on multiple lines, which is <i>not</i> equivalent to using the pipe: multiple lines means that multiple task instances might be spawned simultaneously if matched on more than one line. Contrarily, using the pipe counts as a single match.
</li>
<li>
The scheduler does not check to see if a task finished running before swapning a new instance of it, so that even if a task is not done yet, but it’s time for it to be spawned again, you’ll have multiple instances of the task running at the same time. If this is problematic, consider using <u>application.task</u> <u>(page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|application-task">1↓</a>)</u> in your confuguration scripts instead, with ‘‘false’’ as the last argument.
</li>
</ol>
<div class="Unindented">
You can also setup a special crontab to run arbitrary Java static methods and even non-JVM system processes. Internally, Prudence uses the flexible <a class="URL" href="http://www.sauronsoftware.it/projects/cron4j/">cron4j</a> library. See its documentation for more information.

Prudence attaches your application’s /web/static/ subdirectory to URLs, making files there available via HTTP GET. In other words, /static/web/ is a ‘‘web server.’’ It’s a convenient place for storing immutable resources that your clients will need to run your application: images, styles, scripts, etc.
</div>

You’re likely, though, wondering if /web/static/ is merely a convenience, and if you’d be better off using Apache or other dedicated web servers instead of Prudence to serve your the static files.

Our recommendation is to take that route only if those web servers offer important features that you won’t find in Prudence.

<div class="Unindented">
Prudence handles conditional HTTP automatically for /web/static/: when clients request a new file, they tell Prudence which version they have cached, and Prudence makes sure not to send them the file if they already have the most recent version. Unfortunately, this still does require a short round-trip HTTP request between client and server.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
To avoid even these short requests, Prudence comes with a handy <u>filter (page <a class="Reference" href="#../routing/|filtering">1↓</a>)</u> that can selectively set cache control headers according to file type. By default, the filter sets the max age cache header to the ‘‘far future’’ (ten years) for all files. For most web browsers, and many other clients that support local caching, this effectively causes the files to be cached ‘‘forever.’’ Thus, the client would only request the file again if the cache entry is deleted due to the cache being full, or if the cache is manually reset.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This can allow for faster page rendering in web browsers, save you in bandwidth costs, and help you scale. Sounds perfect? Unfortunately, it also affects your ability to make changes to files. Ten years means ten years: the client does not expect the file to change in that time. Since you likely cannot ask your users to reset their browser caches every time you make a change, what you can do instead is rename the file on your end: because clients cache files according to their URLs, and filenames are mapped to URLs, the client would consider it a fresh file. Of course, you would also have to update references to the URL in HTML and CSS.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Another trick to force clients to re-request an updated file is to add query strings to the URL. For example, consider this HTML code:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;img src="images/logo.png?_=128799073903458"&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The query string is ignored by Prudence’s static web handler, but since it does signify a new URL, the client will use a separate cache entry for it. This lets you keep your filenames, but does require you to alter URLs.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Since the above techniques require considerable discipline from the application maintainers, the cache control filter is not enabled by default in Prudence. The following is an example on how to enable it in an application’s /routing.js, while disabling it for file types that are frequently updated:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">importClass(
	org.restlet.data.MediaType,
	com.threecrickets.prudence.util.CacheControlFilter)

// Disable caching for CSS and JavaScript files
staticWebCacheControlFilter.maxAgeForMediaType.put(MediaType.TEXT_CSS, -1)

When writing JavaScript code, you likely want to use a lot of spacing, indentation and comments to keep the code clear and manageable. You would likely also want to divide your code into multiple files. However, if this code is meant to be run on the client, this could mean sending several overly large files to it.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Prudence comes with a handy <u>filter (page <a class="Reference" href="#../routing/|filtering">1↓</a>)</u> that lets you ‘‘unify’’ several JavaScript files into one, and to ‘‘minify’’ it so that superfluous comments and whitespace are removed. Bandwidth savings can be significant.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The filter works by detecting a user request for a file named ‘‘all.min.js’’ in a directory which contains ‘‘.js’’ files. If the file does not exist, it collects all the JavaScript files in the directory, unifies them in alphabetical order, and minifies the result into a file called ‘‘all.min.js’’. The filter picks up your changes on the fly, and will only regenerate ‘‘all.min.js’’ if you’ve made a change to any of the base files. You can control the minimum time required to pass between these checks via a constructor argument (see example below).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If order of source files within the unified file is important, make sure to name so that an alphabetical sort would put them in the right order.

</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
In Prudence, ‘‘routing’’ refers to the decision-making process by which an incoming client request reaches its handler on the server. Usually, information in the request itself is used to make the decision, such as the URI, cookies, the client type, capabilities and geolocation. But routing can also take server-side and other circumstances into account. For example, a round-robin load-balancing router might send each incoming request to a different handler in sequence. The decision on which handler to use has nothing to do with the a client’s particular request.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A request normally goes through many routers before reaching its handler. Filters along the way can change information in the request, which could also affect routing. Filtering should thus also be thought of as a routing tool.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This abstract, flexible routing mechanism is one of Prudence’s most powerful features, but it’s important to understand these basic principles. A common misconception is that routing is based on the hierarchical structure of URIs, such that a child URI’s routing is somehow affected by its parent URI. While it’s possible to route by parent URI in Prudence, routing is primarily to be understood in terms of the order of routers and filters along the way. A parent and child URI could thus use entirely different handlers.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
When writing applications for Prudence, you will mostly be interested in application-level routing, which we will cover in-depth below. However, to give you a better understanding of how Prudence routing works, let’s follow the journey of a request, starting with routing at the instance level.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-60"></a>Instance Routing
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Before a request reaches your application, it is routed by your Prudence instance.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-86"></a>Step 1: Servers
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Requests come in from servers. Prudence instances have at the minimum one server, but can have more than one. Each server listens at a particular HTTP port, and multiple servers may in turn be restricted to particular network interfaces on your machine. By default, Prudence has a single server that listens to HTTP requests on port 8080 coming in from all network interfaces.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You can configure your servers in <u>/instance/servers.* (page <a class="Reference" href="#../application/|dynamic-web-client-caching-mode">1↑</a>)</u>.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-87"></a>Step 2: The Component
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
There is only one component per Prudence instance, and <i>all </i>servers route to it. This allows Prudence a unified mechanism to deal with all incoming requests.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-88"></a>Step 3: Virtual Hosts<a class="Label" name="../routing/|virtual-hosts"> </a>
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
The component’s router decides which virtual host should receive the request. The decision is often made according to the domain name in the URL, but can also take into account which server it came from. Virtual hosting is a tool to let you host multiple sites on the same Prudence instance, but it can be used for more subtle kinds of routing, too.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
At the minimum you must have one virtual host. By default, Prudence has one that accepts all incoming requests from all servers. If you have multiple servers and want to treat them differently, you can create a virtual host for each.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You can configure your virtual hosts in <u>/instance/hosts.* (page <a class="Reference" href="#../instance/|hosts-file">1↑</a>)</u>.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-89"></a>Step 4: Applications
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Using <u>‘‘hosts’’ in your application’s /settings.* (page <a class="Reference" href="#../application/|hosts">1↑</a>)</u>, you can configure which virtual hosts your application will be attached to, and the base URI for the application on each virtual host. An application can accept requests from several virtual hosts at once.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
To put it another way, there’s a many-to-many relationship between virtual hosts and applications: one host can have many applications, and the same application can be attached to many hosts.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Note that you can create a ‘‘nested’’ URI scheme for your applications. For example, one application might be attached at the root URI at a certain virtual host, ‘‘/’’, while other applications might be at different URIs beneath the root, ‘‘/wackywiki’’ and ‘‘/wackywiki/support/forum’’. The root application will not ‘‘steal’’ requests from the other applications, because the request is routed to the right application by the virtual host. The fact that the latter URI is the hierarchical descendent of the former makes no difference to the virtual host router.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-90"></a>A Complete Route
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Let’s assume a client from the Internet send a request to URI ‘‘http://www.wacky.org/wackywicki/support/forum/thread/12/.’’
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Our machine has two network interfaces, one facing the Internet and one facing the intranet, and we have two servers to listen on each. This particular request has come in through the external server. The request reachers the component’s router.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We have a few virtual hosts: one to handle ‘‘www.wacky.org’’, our organization’s main site, and another to handle ‘‘support.wacky.org’’, a secure site where paying customers can open support tickets.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Our forum application (in the /applications/forum/ subdirectory) is attached to both virtual hosts, but at different URIs. It’s at ‘‘www.wacky.org/wackywiki/support/forum’’ and at ‘‘support.wacky.org/forum’’. In this case, our request is routed to the first virtual host. Though there are a few applications installed at this virtual host, our request follows the route to the forum application.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The remaining part of the URI, ‘‘thread/12/’’ will be further routed inside the forum application, as detailed below.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-61"></a>Application Routing
</h2>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-91"></a>Step 5: Application Handlers
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Prudence applications come with default support for three kinds of handlers: resources (in the /resources/ subdirectory), dynamic web pages (in the /web/dynamic/ subdirectory) and static web resources (in the /web/static/ subdirectory). By default, all three handlers are attached at the root URI, ‘‘/’’, of the application (which may vary per virtual host). However, it is possible to change this in your application’s /settings.*, see <u>resourcesBaseURL, dynamicWebBaseURL and staticWebBaseURL (page <a class="Reference" href="#../application/|resources-base-url">1↑</a>)</u>. For example, you may want your resources to be routed under ‘‘/rest-interface/’’.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You may ask, for any given request, how can the application’s router know which handler to send it to, if all handlers by default assume the same ‘‘/’’ base URL? The answer is that it doesn’t. It tries each handler in sequence, and if one handler cannot handle the request, it falls back to the next one. For example, a ‘‘style/main.css’’ URI will be tried first as a resource. If that resource doesn’t exist, it will be tried as a dynamic web page. Finally, it will be sent to the static web handler.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Be careful: this system allows for previous handlers in the sequence to supersede later handlers. For example, if you decide to remove scriptlets from a file named /dynamic/web/about.html and move it to /static/web/about.html, make sure to delete the former, or else the latter will not be reached.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-92"></a>Subdirectories and Filenames As URI Segments
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
The three application handlers—resources, dynamic web pages and static web resources—are all routed by mapping the filesystem structure to a URI. Each subdirectory path or filename is directly translated into a URI segment.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This is exactly the scheme used by most static web servers, and it has the benefit of using a readily-available, easy-to-use hierarchical structure—the filesystem—as a striaghtforward way for creating URIs.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
There’s one deficiency to this scheme: by directly mapping filenames, it can allow for ‘‘ugly’’ URIs that include filename extensions. For example, you’re probably used to seeing many web sites with URLs that end in ‘‘.html’’, ‘‘.php’’ and ‘‘.jsp’’. While these extensions are meaningful to the site developer, they complicate the URIs and expose internal implementation details to outsiders.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-93"></a>Pretty URIs<a class="Label" name="../routing/|pretty-uris"> </a>
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
To allow for prettier URIs, Prudence does a few things:
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-53"></a>Filename Extension Hiding
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
Prudence ignores filename extensions for the purpose of mapping to URIs. For example, the file ‘‘/web/dynamic/wiki/table-of-contents.html’’ will be mapped to the URI ‘‘wiki/table-of-contents/’’.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-54"></a>Default Files
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
In /web/dynamic/ and /web/static/, if a file ‘‘index.html’’ exists in a subdirectory, it is mapped to the URI for the subdirectory itself. In /resources/, the default file is ‘‘default.*’’.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For example, the file ‘‘/web/dynamic/wiki/contributors/index.html’’ is mapped to the URI ‘‘wiki/contributors/’’. Note that another way to create the same URI is to use ‘‘/web/dynamic/wiki/contributors.html’’ (the ‘‘.html’’ is hidden by Prudence).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Default files are simply another organizational option for you. In very large applications, it can help keep your files well-organized without having any effect on the URIs that exposed externally. You can even change your scheme as your application evolves.
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
The name ‘‘index.html’’ is used by web servers for archaic reasons: it was conceived of as a place where you could list the contents, or ‘‘index,’’ the subdirectory. These days, however, we tend to have a more general understanding of URIs. By default, we’ve followed this convention in Prudence. You can change this with the ‘‘com.threecrickets.prudence.GeneratedTextResource.defaultName’’ application attribute.
</blockquote>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-55"></a>Trailing Slash Requirement<a class="Label" name="../routing/|trailing-slash-requirement"> </a>
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
You’ll note that we used ‘‘wiki/contributors/’’ for the above, rather than ‘‘wiki/contributors’’ (the difference is the trailing slash). This is because Prudence requires trailing slashes by default: trying to access ‘‘wiki/table-of-contents’’ would permanently redirect to ‘‘wiki/table-of-contents/’’.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Prudence does this for two main reasons:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
To keep the URI space consistent, whether you use subdirectories or filenames to create the URI segments.
</li>
<li>
This is Prudence’s way of fighting to the ‘‘trailing slash’’ problem, which plagues the use of relative URIs in HTML and CSS.
</li>
</ol>
<div class="Unindented">
You can turn off the trailing slash requirement via the ‘‘com.threecrickets.prudence.GeneratedTextResource.trailingSlashRequired’’ and ‘‘com.threecrickets.prudence.DelegatedResource.trailingSlashRequired’’ application.globals.
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
In Prudence 1.0, the filename extension hiding and trailing slash requirement work only for /resources/ and /web/dynamic/ URLs. /web/static/ URLs still map full filenames. A future version of Prudence may extend these features to all resources.
</blockquote>
<div class="Unindented">
If you’d like a specific non-trailing-slash URL to automatically redirect to the trailing-slash equivalent, use the <u>application’s ‘‘urlAddTrailingSlash’’ setting (page <a class="Reference" href="#../application/|url-add-trailing-slash">1↑</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-56"></a>Overriding Pretty URIs
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
You can override all the automatic prettifying techniques mentioned above by explicitly <u>capturing URIs (page <a class="Reference" href="#../routing/|capturing">1↓</a>)</u>. For example:

<pre class="listing">router.capture(’sitemap.xml’, ’sitemap/’)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-94"></a>Filename Extensions
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Though Prudence hides the filename extensions from the URIs, they do have two important functions:
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-57"></a>Filename Extensions and MIME Types<a class="Label" name="../routing/|extensions-mime-types"> </a>
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
Filename extensions define the default media type for ‘‘GET’’ requests to pages in /web/dynamic/ and /web/static/. For example, a ‘‘.xml’’ file will be mapped to the ‘‘application/xml’’ MIME type.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Every application has its own <u>filename extension mapping table (page <a class="Reference" href="#../application/|default-file">1↑</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Additionally, you can explicitly set the MIME type in a code via <u>conversation.mediaTypeName (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-media-type">1↓</a>)</u>, overriding the default.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-58"></a>Filename Extensions and Programming Languages
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
In /resources/, and for configuration scripts, the filename extension tells Prudence the programming language of the source code. Prudence supports ‘‘.py’’, ‘‘.rb’’, ‘‘.js’’, ’’.php’’, ‘‘.clj’’ and ‘‘.php’’ files.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-59"></a>Filename Extensions Preference
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
In /resources/, the Prudence flavor you are using will determine which file to use in the case of ambiguity. For example, the Groovy flavor will prefer ‘‘process.gv’’ file even if ‘‘process.js’’ is present. This allows you to write and deploy applications that can run in multiple Prudence flavors. The same is true for configuration scripts.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
However, in /web/dynamic/ there is no explicit preference, and behavior is undefined if you have more than one file with the same name but different extension in the same subdirectory. For example, contents.html and contents.xml.

<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-62"></a>Custom Routing

For example, in /routing.* (JavaScript flavor):

​
router.capture(’forum/help/{topic}/’, ’forum/help/’)

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Capturing might look like redirection, but in fact it’s an <i>internal</i> redirection, similar to how the <u>document.internal API works (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|document-internal">1↓</a>)</u>. The client remains entirely ignorant as to what internal URIs you might be using.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
It’s important to understand this distinction: the client might be seeing an entirely different URI than your internal one. Thus, if you’re using HTML and CSS, you need to make sure that your relative references reach the right place. This is easy in Prudence with the <u>conversation.pathToBase API (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-path-to-base">1↓</a>)</u>, which will use the captive client URI. For example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are viewing help topic &lt;%= conversation.locals.get(’topic’) %&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="&lt;%= conversation.pathToBase %&gt;/images/help.png"/&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Capturing in this manner is often used in conjunction with <u>URI hiding (page <a class="Reference" href="#../routing/|hiding">1↑</a>)</u>. By hiding ‘‘/forum/help/’’, users would be able to access ‘‘/forum/help/faq/’’ via HTTP, but not ‘‘/forum/help/’’. This lets you effectively control the exposed URI space. In fact, capturing and hiding is common enough that it has its own shortcut API:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">router.captureAndHide(’forum/help/{topic}/’, ’forum/help/’)
​
The above is identical to:
​
router.capture(’forum/help/{topic}/’, ’forum/help/’)
router.hide(’forum/help/’)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Another feature of internal redirection is that your code you can check for internal access and enforce it. As an example, let’s implement URI hiding via a scriptlet:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;%
if(!conversation.internal) {
	conversation.statusCode = 404 // resource not found
}
%&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are viewing help topic &lt;%= conversation.locals.get(’topic’) %&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Prudence also lets you capture into a different application in the instance. Refer to applications using their subdirectory name. For example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">// Implement defaults
document.execute(’defaults/application/routing/’);
​
router.captureOther(’/forum/help/{topic}/’, ’wackyhelp’, ’/help/’)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In addition to parsing URI segments, you can use predefined curly-bracket-delimited variables to route based on attributes of the request, via <u>URI patterns (page <a class="Reference" href="#../routing/|uri-patterns">1↓</a>)</u>. For example, we can route with the ‘‘{m}’’ variable (HTTP method) to elegantly handle HTTP forms:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">router.capture(’message/’, ’message/{m}/’)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We can then have a dynamic web page named ‘‘/message/GET.html’’:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form method="post"&gt;
	Enter your message:&lt;br/&gt;

Another example of capturing with URI patterns:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">router.capture(’data/client/’, ’data/client/{emt}/’)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Because ‘‘{emt}’’ is the MIME type of data sent by the client, we can have files such as these:
</div>
<ul>

<li>
/resources/data/client/text/html/default.js
</li>
<li>
/resources/data/client/application/json/default.js
</li>
<li>
/resources/data/client/default.js (this will be used if no client data is sent, for example in an HTTP GET)
</li>
</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
Of course, you might prefer to check the MIME type in code your code via <u>conversation.mediaTypeName (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-media-type">1↓</a>)</u>, but the above is a good example of how powerful routing can be with URI patterns.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-97"></a>Capturing Errors<a class="Label" name="../routing/|capturing-errors"> </a>
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
A special case of capturing is for errors. ‘‘Errors’’ can be set explicitly by you: for example, we can set <u>conversation.statusCode (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-status-code">1↓</a>)</u> to 404, as we did above. However, a 500 error occurs automatically for uncaught exceptions in your code.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you have debug mode enabled, the user would see the special debug page for 500 errors; see <u>debugging (page <a class="Reference" href="#../debugging/">1↓</a>)</u>. On a production site, you may instead prefer to capture the 500 error and provide a friendlier page. (You’d also want to test carefully and make sure your code never throws exceptions…)
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You can capture errors both at the application level or at the instance level, which the former taking precedence. It may be a good idea to always capture at the instance level, in case applications don’t capture for their own custom error pages.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Examples from /instance/routing.* (JavaScript flavor):

<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">

</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Notes for error capturing:
</div>
<ul>

<li>
You always need to specify the application name (like router.captureOther).
</li>
<li>
As with regular capturing, you can hide these pages if you don’t want users to be able to access them directly. (Though, if you hide your 404 page, users would still get to it because it’s what would be displayed for hidden pages! The difference is that it would appear to users with a 404 status, not a 200 success status.)
</li>
<li>
The difference between statusService.capture and statusService.captureHostRoot is in how the base URI is set, which affects the conversation.pathToBase API. statusService.capture uses to the application’s base URI on the current virtual host, while statusService.captureHostRoot uses to the virtual host root itself.
</li>
<li>
For 500 error capturing, you should prefer a /web/static/ page, which has the least chance of generating an exception and causing a 500 error again, resulting in a loop.

</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
By ‘‘static’’ here is meant that redirection is configured into the application’s /routing.* script. (You can also call this API on a running application, though you should realize that it essentially changed your application’s routing.) ‘‘Dynamic’’ routing, from within /dynamic/web/ or /resources/, is described in the <u>next section (page <a class="Reference" href="#../routing/|dynamic-redirection">1↓</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Because static redirection supports <u>URI patterns (page <a class="Reference" href="#../routing/|uri-patterns">1↓</a>)</u>, this API can actually handle complex ‘‘dynamic’’ redirections. For example, even though most clients will support relative URI paths for redirection, you can force a complete URI using the ‘‘{rp}’’ pattern, which equals is the request URI path.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The following redirection status codes are supported:
</div>
<ul>

<li>
301, permanent: Most clients will cache this redirection, thus avoiding subsequent requests to the original URI
</li>
<li>
302, client found: This <i>should </i>be a temporary redirect, like 307, but many clients treat it as a 303. Best to avoid, unless you enjoy confusion.
</li>
<li>
303, see other: Clients assume that you have processed their request, and should send a GET to the new URI in order to receive the results of the processing. Use with care!
</li>
<li>
307, temporary: The default (because it’s the safest)
</li>
</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
Note that behind the scenes, static redirection is handled by <u>attaching (page <a class="Reference" href="#../routing/|attaching">1↓</a>)</u> a <a class="URL" href="http://www.restlet.org/documentation/2.0/jse/api/index.html?org/restlet/routing/Redirector.html">Redirector restlet</a>.

<ul>

<li>

<div class="Unindented">
Instances of <a class="URL" href="http://www.restlet.org/documentation/2.0/jse/api/index.html?org/restlet/routing/Filter.html">filters</a>, which wrap instances of other restlets, can be attached directly to URIs. The filter can then pass control to the ‘‘next’’ restlet, skip other filters along the chain, or immediately stop routing.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
There are many use cases for filters. Here are just a few common ones:
</div>
<ul>

<li>
Guards: they check if the client’s request has the right authorization (has the right cookie, originated at a white-listed IP address, etc.) before letting it continue. On stopping, they usually set the <u>conversation.statusCode (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-status-code">1↓</a>)</u> to either 401 (‘‘unauthorized’’) or 402 (‘‘forbidden’’).
</li>
<li>
Sanitizers: they remove harmful data or code from the client request, remove private or offensive material from the response, etc.
</li>
<li>
Transformers: they translate, re-encode, decorate or otherwise transform response entities between various formats.
</li>
<li>
Monitors: they can log each request passing through, accumulate statistics, alert administrators, etc.
</li>
<li>
Throttles: they can refuse to pass requests on if the system is overloaded, if the client has exceeded a quota, etc. On stopping, they usually set the <u>conversation.statusCode (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-status-code">1↓</a>)</u> to 503 (‘‘service unavailable’’).
</li>
<li>
Cachers: they can fetch from a cache according to request attributes, and store in a cache according to response attributes.
</li>
<li>
Post-processors: they can find and interpret special codes, scriptlets, headers, etc., in the response as commands to execute.
</li>
</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
In addition to the standard Restlet API, Prudence allows for a few useful shortcuts for filtering.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Here’s an example of filtering all static web requests through the <u>JavaScriptUnifyMinifyFilter (page <a class="Reference" href="#../static-web/|javascript-unify-minify-filter">1↑</a>)</u>:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">importClass(com.threecrickets.prudence.util.JavaScriptUnifyMinifyFilter)
​
// This will detach staticWeb and attach our filter instead with staticWeb chained to it;
// also note that the context for staticWeb will be used for the filter, so we can specify
// null for the context in the constructor
// (this is Prudence sugar)
​
var filter = new JavaScriptUnifyMinifyFilter(null,
	new File(applicationBasePath + staticWebBasePath), dynamicWebMinimumTimeBetweenValidityChecks)
​
router.filterBase(staticWebBaseURL, filter, staticWeb)
​
// The above is equivalent to this:

​
router.detach(staticWeb)
router.attachBase(staticWebBaseURL)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You can also filter the entire application by replacing its inbound router with a filter. For example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">var myFilter = new MyFilter(applicationInstance.context)
​
myFilter.next = applicationInstance.inboundRoot
applicationInstance.inboundRoot = myFilter

<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-60"></a>Custom Filters
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
Prudence lets you easily create your own <u>custom filters (page <a class="Reference" href="#../handlers/|filters">1↑</a>)</u>. The API for routing through them is almost identical to the above shortcut, except that, instead of a filter instance, you use the internal URI of the handler in the application’s /handlers/ subdirectory. For example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">router.filterBase(dynamicWebBaseURL, ’remove-foul-language/’, dynamicWebBase)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The above is a useful shortcut, but in some cases you will need access to the actual filter instance. You would then need to explicitly create a <a class="URL" href="http://threecrickets.com/prudence/api/index.html?com/threecrickets/prudence/DelegatedFilter.html">DelegatedFilter instance</a>.

<div class="Unindented">
Our JavaScript engine, Rhino, does not provide dictionary access to maps, so you must use get- and put- notation to access map attributes. For example, use application.globals.get(’myapp.data.name’) rather than application.globals[’myapp.data.name’].

This lets you control the key that is used to store and retrieve the cached output of the current document. <i>Note that this is not necessarily the key itself</i>, but instead a pattern that can contain variables that are set dynamically.

The cache key itself is cast from the cache key pattern for every request reaching your document.

Cache key patterns are a very powerful feature that lets you easily create different cached versions of documents for different kinds of users and requests, but it’s not always trivial to determine the best cache key pattern for every situation. It depends strongly on how you use and cache your fragments.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The default cache key pattern is ‘‘{ri}|{dn}|{ptb}’’, which is a string containing the request identifier (the URI), the document name, the <u>path to base (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|conversation-path-to-base">1↓</a>)</u>. An actual key could thus be: ‘‘http://mysite.org/wackywiki/main|/common/header.html’’. This default is sensible, because it makes sure that included fragments are cached invidually. For example, only using ‘‘{ri}’’ would have each included fragment use the same key and override others.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
However, though sensible, the default cache key pattern may not be the most efficient. For example, if the header fragment used in the example above never changes per page, then it’s wasteful to cache it separately per URI. It would be more efficient to set document.cacheKeyPattern = ‘‘{an}|{dn}’’ or ‘‘{an}|{ptb}|{dn}’’ in a scriptlet in header.html.

Rule of thumb: Set document.cacheKeyPattern to be as short as you possibly can, but not too short that it won’t differentiate between different views.

Calling document.include is equivalent to using the <u>include scriptlet, &lt;%&amp; … %&gt; (page <a class="Reference" href="#../generating-html/|includes-and-fragments">1↑</a>)</u>. Internally, the include scriptlet is turned into a regular scriptlet that calls document.include.
</blockquote>
<div class="Unindented">
There are three main use cases for inclusion:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
This mechanism allows you to divide your documents into fragments that you can re-use in many documents, helping you manage large applications and keep them consistent. Fragments can include other fragments, those can include others, etc. A common strategy is to separate the document header and footer into fragments and include these in all pages.
</li>
<li>
Because each document fragment can have its own caching properties, fragmentation is also an important strategy for fine-grained caching. It’s important to keep in mind, though, that the outermost document’s cacheDuration will override all others. If a cached version of a document is used, then it is not executed, which means that document.include calls in it are not executed, too.
</li>
<li>
Scriptlets in the fragments can include re-usable code, such as function and class definitions. You can thus use document.include to include code libraries. You might want to consider, though, using <u>document.execute (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|document-execute">1↓</a>)</u> instead, as it will let you use regular source code documents and not have to use scriptlets.

The included path is an internal URI, not the external URL visible to the world. The URI can be relative to either /web/dynamic/ in the case of scriptlets, /resources/ in the case of resources, or to /libraries/ in either case. The /libraries/ subdirectory is indeed the best place to put code usable by all parts of your application.

Prudence might compile or otherwise prepare and cache code in the executed document. What ‘‘preparation’’ actually involves depends on the language of the source code.

The main difference between document.include and document.execute is that the former expects ‘‘text-with-scriptlets’’ documents, while the latter uses plain source code.
</blockquote>
<div class="Unindented">
Common use cases:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
The executed code can be re-usable, such as function and class definitions. This allows you to treat it as a code library. Notes:
<ol>

<li>
In most cases, you would probably want to use your language’s code inclusion mechanism instead of document.execute. For example, use ‘‘import’’ in Python, Ruby and PHP, and ‘‘require’’ in Clojure. The native inclusion mechanism would do a better job at caching code, managing namespaces, avoiding duplication, etc. For example, if you use document.execute in Clojure, then you would have to use defonce rather than def to avoid duplication in case you execute the same document multiple times in the same context.
</li>
<li>
For JavaScript and Groovy flavors: Prudence’s document.execute is your only option for code inclusion in Prudence, because both JavaScript and Groovy do not have a code inclusion mechanism.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
The executed code does not have to be in the same language as the calling code. This lets you use multiple languages in your applications, using the strengths of each. Note that languages cannot normally share function and class definitions, but can share state, via mechanisms such as application.globals, if the languages use compatible structures.
</li>
<li>
Use document.execute as an alternative to document.include if you prefer not to use scriptlets. For example, executing mylibrary.js might be more readable than including a fragment called mylibrary.html that is all just one JavaScript scriptlet.

<div class="Indented">
Common use cases:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
By letting you use your REST resources both internally and externally, document.internal lets you create unified resource API. document.internal directly accesses the resource (not via HTTP), so it is just about as fast as a simple function call, and is definitely scalable. Thus, there may be no need to create a separate set of functions for you to use internally and HTTP resources for external clients to use. A unified API would minimize the possibility of bugs and add coherence to your code, by enforcing a RESTful architecture all around. A second advantage is that you could trivially make your API remote by running it on a different Prudence instance, and using <u>document.external (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|document-external">1↓</a>)</u> instead. This could allow for an easy way to run your application in a cluster, behind a load balancer.
</li>
<li>
You can create unit tests for your resources without having to start an HTTP server.
</li>
<li>
The defrosting mechanism uses document.internal to load resources.

<div class="Indented">
The first argument is a full URL. The second argument is the preferred media type name.

<div class="Indented">
Common use cases:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
You can add scale and redundancy to your internal REST API by running several Prudence instances behind a load balancer, and using document.external instead of document.internal.
</li>
<li>
You can use Prudence to create an internal communication backbone for your enterprise, with various backend services exposing resources to each other. You can expose the same resources to business partners, allowing for ‘‘B2B’’ (business-to-business) services.
</li>
<li>
There are many, many use cases for document.external, and they keep growing as REST is adopted by service providers on the Internet. There are online storage, publishing and content delivery systems, public databases, archives, geolocation services, social networking applications, etc. Perhaps, with Prudence, you will create the next one.
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="Quote">
Important: The semantics of ClientResource require you to explicitly release the response as soon as you’re done using it, which will in turn release the thread used to stream the response to you. (Though these threads might eventually be reclaimed by a built-in garbage collection mechanism, leaving them hanging could lead to starvation, such that further uses of document.external will block until threads return to the pool.) It’s probably best to employ a try-finally paradigm, where the try clause contains as little code as possible, and the finally clause releases the response. See the example below.

<div class="Unindented">
This is a good place to remind you that REST is not just HTTP.

<div class="Unindented">

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-118"></a>Global Variables<a class="Label" name="../api/|global-variables"> </a>
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
You know how local variables work in your programming language: they exist only for the duration of a function call, after which their state is discarded. If you want state to persist beyond the function call, you use a global variable (or a ‘‘static’’ local, which is really a global).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<i>But in Prudence, you cannot expect global variables to persist beyond a user request.</i> To put it another way, you should consider every single user request as a separate ‘‘program’’ with its own global state. See the ‘‘life’’ sections for <u>generating HTML (page <a class="Reference" href="#../generating-html/|life">1↑</a>)</u> and <u>resources (page <a class="Reference" href="#../resources/|life">1↑</a>)</u> for more information on when this global state is created and discarded. If you need global variables to persist, you must use <u>application.globals (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|application-globals">1↑</a>)</u> or <u>executable.globals (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|executable-globals">1↑</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Why does Prudence discard your language’s globals? This has to do with allowing for concurrency while shielding you from the complexity of having to guarantee the thread-safety of your code. By making each user request a separate ‘‘program,’’ you don’t have to worry about overlapping shared state, coordinating thread access, etc., for every use of a variable.
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
The exception to this is code in /resources/, in which language globals <i>might</i> persist. To improve performance, Prudence caches the global context for these in memory, with the side effect that your language globals persist beyond a single user request. For various reasons, however, Prudence may reset this global context. You should not rely on this side effect, and instead always use <u>application.globals (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|application-globals">1↑</a>)</u> or even <u>executable.globals (page <a class="Reference" href="#../api/|executable-globals">1↑</a>)</u>.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-119"></a>application.globals vs. executable.globals
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
You should prefer application.globals. By doing so, you’ll minimize interdependencies between applications, and help make each application deployable on its own.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
It’s best to use executable.globals as an <i>optional</i> bridge between applications. Examples:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
To save resources. For example, if an application detects that a database connection has already been opened by another application in the Prudence instance, and stored in executable.globals, then it could use that connection rather than create a new one. This would only work, of course, if a few applications share the same database.
</li>
<li>
To send messages between applications. This would be necessary if operations in one application could affect another. For example, you could place a task queue in executable.globals, where application could queue required operations. A thread in another application would consume these and act accordingly. Of course, you will have to plan for asynchronous behavior, and especially allow for failure. What happens if the consumer application is down?
</li>
</ol>
<div class="Unindented">
Generally, if you find yourself having to rely on executable.globals, ask yourself if your code would be better off encapsulated as a single application. Remember that Prudence has powerful URL routing, support for virtual hosting, etc., letting you easily have one application work in several sites simultaneously
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
Note for Clojure flavor: All Clojure vars are VM-wide globals equivalent in scope to executable.globals. You usually work with namespaces that Prudence creates on the fly, so they do not persist beyond the execution. However, if you explicitly define a namespace, then you use it as a place for shared state. It will then be up to you to make sure that your namescape doesn’t collide with that of another application installed in the Prudence insstance. Though this approach might seem to break our rule of thumb here, of preferring application.globals to executable.globals, it is more idiomatic to Clojure and Lisps more generally.

Note for Clojure flavor: Though Clojure goes a long way towards simplifying concurrent programming, it does not solve the problem of concurrent access to global state. You still need to read this section!

For example, this code (Python flavor) is broken:
</div>

<div class="Indented">
The problem is that in the short interval between comparing the value in the ‘‘if’’ statement and setting the global value in the ‘‘then’’ statement, another thread may have already set the value.

</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
This may seem like a very rare occurence to you: another thread would have to set the value <i>exactly</i> between our comparison and our set.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-122"></a>Optimizing for Performance
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
You may have noticed, in the code above, that if another thread had already set the global value, then our created data source would be discarded. If data source creation is heavy and slow, then this could significantly affect our performance. The only way to guarantee that this would not happen would be to make the entire operation atomic, by synchronizing it with a lock:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Here’s an example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">def get_connection()
	lock = application.getGlobal(’myapp.data.source.lock’, RLock())
	lock.acquire()

		if data_source is None:
			data_source = data_source_factory.create()
			application.globals[’myapp.data.source’] = data_source
		return data_source.get_connection()
	finally:
		lock.release()
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Note that we have to store our RLock as a unique global, too.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Not only is the code above complicated, but synchronization has its own performance penalties, which <i>might</i> make this apparent optimization actually perform worse. It’s definitely not a good idea to blindly apply this technique: attempt it only if you are experiencing a problem with resource use or performance, and then make sure that you’re not making things worse with synchronization.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If all else fails, then Prudence’s globals may not be the best solution for your problem. Look into creating an external service (possibly written in Java) to manage global connections for you.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Here’s a final version of our get_connection function that lets you control whether to lock access:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">def get_connection(lock_access=False)
	if lock_access:
		lock = application.getGlobal(’myapp.data.source.lock’, RLock())

	try:
		data_source = application.globals[’myapp.data.source’]
		if data_source is None:
			data_source = data_source_factory.create()
			if lock_access:
				application.globals[’myapp.data.source’] = data_source

As of Prudence version 1.0, you cannot set breakpoints in your code, unless it’s in Java. Future versions of Prudence may allow breakpoints for some flavors, as supported languages add more debugging features. However, we do not feel that this is such a great loss, or that it would adversely affect your ability to develop for Prudence. The combination of robust logging and the debug page can go a long way towards helping you diagnose your problems.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-74"></a>Sending Messages
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Whether messages actually are written to the log file depends on your logging configuration. Messages are ranked by levels, and loggers are configured to allow only messages up to a certain level. Smart, consistent use of log levels will increase the debuggability of your application.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The logging methods and their common uses are these (shown for the base logger, but work the same for sub-loggers):
</div>
<ol>

<li>
application.logger.severe: ‘‘Severe’’ messages are used for unrecoverable errors, alerts about unavailable computing resources, network backends, etc. You’d always want to configure logging to include these messages!
</li>
<li>
application.logger.warning: While not quite severe, the event could still point out a problem that, if left un-handled, might become severe, either now or in the future. Many applications emit copious warnings that can be safely ignored.
</li>
<li>
application.logger.info: These don’t report a problem, but instead are used to mark an occurrence of an event. Useful for monitoring and high-level debugging.
</li>
<li>
application.logger.config: Treat these as components of an event that together would constitute a single ‘‘info’’ message. They are meant to show how the event was initialized or released. Useful for low-level debugging of events.
</li>
<li>
application.logger.fine: General purpose, low-level debugging.
</li>
<li>
application.logger.finer: Even lower!
</li>
<li>
application.logger.finest: Lowest of the low!

<div class="Unindented">
An ‘‘appender’’ is the service that actually writes log messages. Appenders are configured with properties prefixed with ‘‘log4j.appender.X’’, where X is the name of the appender.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Prudence by default uses two rolling file appenders, one called ‘‘web’’ for web.log, and one called ‘‘prudence’’ for prudence.log. Additionally, a console appender named ‘‘console’’ and a remote appender named ‘‘remote’’ are configured, though they are not used by default.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-126"></a>Loggers
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
A ‘‘logger’’ is the service to which you send your log messages. It decides whether to write the message according to its level, and if so sends it to one or more appenders. Loggers are configured with properties prefixed with ‘‘log4j.logger.X’’, where X is the name of the logger. Logger names appear in the logs for every message, and are thus useful for organization your log.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You do not have to define all your loggers in logging.conf. Any logger name can be used by your application. If it is not found in logging.conf, then default attributes are inherited. Inheritence works by treating logger names hierarchically: if you do not specify a certain attribute for a logger, then its parent logger is used. The nameless root logger, configured with the ‘‘log4j.rootLogger’’ prefix, defines defaults for all loggers.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You can configure your application’s logger and sub-loggers. For example, if your application is named ‘‘wackywiki,’’ you can set its maximum logging level thus:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">log4j.logger.wackywiki=WARN
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Log levels in logging.conf are named a bit differently from the commands used in application.logger:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
application.logger.severe: ERROR
</li>
<li>
application.logger.warning: WARN
</li>
<li>
application.logger.info: INFO
</li>
<li>
application.logger.config: DEBUG
</li>
<li>
application.logger.fine: DEBUG
</li>
<li>
application.logger.finer: DEBUG
</li>
<li>
application.logger.finest: TRACE (or ALL)
</li>

<blockquote class="Quote">
The differences are due to the preponderance of logging solutions for the JVM, which are used in some of Prudence’s underlying libraries. We hope to streamline this further in a future version of Prudence.

Prudence comes with built-in support Apache Commons Daemon. However, in production environments, you might prefer to use one of the daemon <i>wrappers</i>, which provide process monitoring and control. For example, if Prudence’s JVM crashes for some reason, hangs, grabs too much CPU or RAM, the wrapper can automatically shut it down and even restart it.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Though Prudence comes with the necessary configuration files for wrappers, it does not include the actual wrappers, which you will need to install separately. The reason we haven’t included them is different for each wrapper: Tanuki’s JSW uses a restrictive license (GPL) that will not allow us to distribute it with Prudence, and YAJSW is just far too big.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-79"></a>Apache Commons Daemon
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The <u>/bin/ scripts (page <a class="Reference" href="#../instance/|bin">1↑</a>)</u> allow you to ‘‘start’’, ‘‘stop’’, ‘‘restart’’ and check the running ‘‘status’’ for the Prudence daemon (called a ‘‘service’’ in Windows). The daemon will write its log to ‘‘/logs/run.log’’.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Though you need root privileges (sudo) to start or stop the daemon, the daemon itself will attempt to run under user ‘‘prudence-X’’, where ‘‘X’’ is the name of the flavor you are using. For example, ‘‘prudence-python’’ is used for the Python flavor. If that user doesn’t exist, the daemon will run under <i>your </i>user.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In any case, it’s up to you to make sure that the daemon’s user has the necessary read and write privileges for the Prudence files. In particular, it needs to be able to write to /logs/ and to /cache/.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The scripts work by detecting your running environment and attempting to use the appropriate <a class="URL" href="http://commons.apache.org/daemon/">Apache Commons Daemon</a> binary. Prudence comes with binaries for Linux, Solaris, Darwin (OS X) and Windows, for both 32bit and 64bit architectures.

</li>
<li>
The /bin/run.sh script can be installed as an /etc/init.d/ script, so it can also be run via Upstart, like so:

<li>
Newer Linux operating systems might give you an error about a missing ‘‘libcap.so.1’’ library. In such cases, you will need to install your operating system’s Apache Commons Daemon package. In Ubuntu, for example, it is package ‘‘jsvc’’. The /bin/run.sh script will always try to use your operating system’s jsvc before falling back to the binary that comes with Prudence.

<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-131"></a>Notes for Windows

<ul>

<li>
You need to ‘‘install’’ the service before you can ‘‘start’’ it. Use ‘‘uninstall’’ if you need to remove it.

Note that Windows requires your service executable (in the /commons-daemon/ subdirectory) to be on a local drive. It will fail on network drives.

There’s nothing special about how Prudence handles HTTP, and it can work easily behind any reverse proxy. This lets you easily unite Prudence with other web servers or run it behind a load balancer.

</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-82"></a>Perlbal

<div class="Unindented">
You can run many instances of Prudence behind a load balancer. This offers fault tolerance, maintenance options, and the possibility of dramatically scaling up the number of requests you can support. Your application can tolerate failure of any number of instances, as long as you have one running, because load balancers will automatically route to working instances. Similarly, load balancing allows you to bring some instances down for maintenance while keeping your application up and running.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Scaling up can be straightforward: simply add more and more instances behind the load balancer, which will make sure to distribute requests among them, while monitoring their responsiveness to accommodate for how well they handle their load. More complex systems can involve different kinds of instances, with the load balancer being in charge of routing requests to the appropriate pool of instances. This ‘‘partitioning’’ can be according to features (one pool handles chat room, one pool handles file downloads), geography (one pool handles England, one pool handles France), or other clever ways to keep the whole system efficient and responsive. See <u>Scaling Tips (page <a class="Reference" href="#../../scaling/">1↓</a>) </u>for an in-depth treatment.

<a class="URL" href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>’s HTTP server is often called the ‘‘Swiss army knife of the Internet’’ for how well it manipulates URLs and routes HTTP requests.

</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
Why use Prudence for a Restlet application that already works?
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Though applications can be written in Prudence without a single line of Java code, Prudence also acts as a useful container for existing Restlet applications, Restlet resources or restlets written in Java.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Prudence makes it easy to handle the bootstrapping and <u>routing (page <a class="Reference" href="#../application/|routing-file">1↑</a>)</u> of your applications, and the <u>Administration Application (page <a class="Reference" href="#../administration/">1↑</a>)</u>, <u>debugging (page <a class="Reference" href="#../debugging/">1↑</a>)</u> and <u>logging (page <a class="Reference" href="#../logging/">1↑</a>)</u> features make it easier to deploy and manage multiple applications together. These issues have more to do with your application’s configuration, rather than its functionality, and it can be useful to handle them outside of the Java build process, using live, dynamic languages in simple text source that you can modify on the fly. Deploying your Restlet application to a Prudence instance can be as simple as copying a zip file to a Prudence container.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This need is also fulfilled by servlet and Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) containers, such as Tomcat, Resin and JBoss. Indeed, Restlet has a JEE edition, and good support for servlets. However, if all you need is a deployment container, Prudence can serve as a straightforward, pure REST alternative to JEE. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Some people also look to JEE containers for their support of Java Server Pages (JSP). We urge you to take a good look at Prudence’s <u>dynamic web (page <a class="Reference" href="#../generating-html/">1↑</a>)</u> support. It may surpass JSP for your purposes. In particular, it is based on Restlet, which you already know and love, giving you the entire Restlet API at your fingertips. It also lets you use many wonderful languages other than Java for scriptlets. For simpler templating, Velocity and Succinct are also built in and immediately ready to use.

</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
Scalability is the ability to respond to a growing number of user requests without degradation in response time. Two variables influence it: 1) your total number of threads and 2) the time it takes each thread to process a request. Increasing the number of threads seems straightforward: you can keep adding more machines behind load balancers. However, the two variables are tied, as there are diminishing returns and even reversals: beyond a certain point, time per request can actually grow longer as you add threads and machines.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Let’s ignore the first variable here, because the challenge of getting more machines is mostly financial. It’s the second that you can do something about as an engineer.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you want your application to handle many concurrent users, then you’re fighting this fact: a request will get queued in the best case or discarded in the worst case if there is no thread available to serve it. Your challenge is to make sure that a thread is always available. And it’s not easy, as you’ll find out as you read through this article. Minimizing the time per request becomes an architectural challenge that encompasses the entire structure of your application

<div class="Indented">
Get it? Performance does not equal scalability.

This is an important mantra for two reasons:
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-132"></a>1. Performant Can Mean Less Scalable
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Optimizing for performance can adversely affect your scalability. The reason is contextual: when you optimize for performance, you often work in an isolated context, specifically so you can accurately measure response times and fine-tune them. For example, making sure that a specific SQL query is fast would involve just running that query. A full-blown experiment involving millions of users doing various operations on your application would make it very hard to accurately measure and optimize the query. Unfortunately, by working in an isolated context you cannot easily see how your efforts would affect other parts of an application. To do so would require a lot of experience and imagination. To continue our example, in order to optimize your one SQL query you might create an index. That index might need to be synchronized with many servers in your cluster. And that synchronization overhead, in turn, could seriously affect your ability to scale. Congratulations! You’ve made one query run fast in a situation that never happens in real life, and you’ve brought your web site to a halt.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
One way to try to get around this is to fake scale. Tools such as <a class="URL" href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/">JMeter</a>, <a class="URL" href="http://www.joedog.org/index/siege-home">Siege</a> and <a class="URL" href="http://httpd.apache.org/">ApacheBench</a> can create ‘‘load.’’ They also create unfounded confidence in engineers. If you simulate 10,000 users bombarding a single web page, then you’re, as before, working in an isolated context. All you’ve done is add concurrency to your performance optimization measurements. Your application pathways might work optimally in these situations, but this might very well be due to the fact that the system is not doing anything else. Add those ‘‘other’’ operations in, and you might get worse site capacity than you did before ‘‘optimizing.’’
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-133"></a>2. Wasted Effort
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Even if you don’t adversely affect your scalability through optimizing for performance, you might be making no gains, either. No harm done? Well, plenty of harm, maybe. Optimizing for performance might waste a lot of development time and money. This effort would be better spent on work that could actually help scalability.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
And, perhaps more seriously, it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem field. If you don’t know what your problems are, you’ll never be able to solve them.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-134"></a>Pitfalls
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Study the problem field carefully. Understand the challenges and potential pitfalls. You don’t have to apply every single scalability strategy up-front, but at least make sure you’re not making a fatal mistake, such as binding yourself strongly to a technology or product with poor scalability. A bad decision can mean that when you need to scale up in the future, no amount of money and engineering effort would be able to save you before you lose customers and tarnish your brand.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Moreover, be very careful of blindly applying ‘‘successful’’ strategies used and recommended by others to your product. What worked for them might not work for you. In fact, there’s a chance that their strategy doesn’t even work for them, and they just think it did because of a combination of seemingly unrelated factors. The realm of web scalability is still young, full of guesswork, intuition and magical thinking. Even the experts are often making it up as they’re going along.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Generally, be very suspicious of products or technologies being touted as ‘‘faster’’ than others. <i>‘‘Fast’’ doesn’t say anything about the ability to scale.</i> Is a certain database engine ‘‘fast’’? That’s important for certain applications, no doubt. But maybe the database is missing important clustering features, such that it would be a poor choice for scalable applications. Does a certain programming language execute faster than another? That’s great if you’re doing video compression, but speed of execution might not have have noticeable effect on scalability. Web applications mostly do I/O, not computation. The same web application might have very similar performance characteristics whether it’s written in C++ or PHP.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Moreover, if the faster language is difficult to work with, has poor debugging tools, limited integration with web technologies, then it would slow down your work and your ability to scale.
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
Speed of execution can actually help scalability in its financial aspect: If your application servers are constantly at maximum CPU load, then a faster execution platform would let you cram more web threads into each server. This will help you reduce costs. For example, see <a class="URL" href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/358">Facebook's HipHop</a>: they saved millions by translating their PHP code to C. Because Prudence is built on the fast JVM platform, you’re in good hands in this respect. Note, however, that there’s a potential pitfall to high performance: more threads threads per machine would also mean more RAM requirements per machine, which also costs money. Crunch the numbers and make sure that you’re actually saving money by increasing performance. Once again, performance does not equal scalability.
</blockquote>
<div class="Unindented">
That last point about programming languages is worth some elaboration. Beyond how well your chosen technologies perform, it’s important to evaluate them in terms to how easy they are to manage. Large web sites are large projects, involving large teams of people and large amounts of money. That’s difficult enough to coordinate. You want the technology to present you with as few extra managerial challenges as possible.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Beware especially of languages and platforms described as ‘‘agile,’’ as if they somehow embody the spirit of the popular <a class="URL" href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>. Often, ‘‘agile’’ seems to emphasize the following features: forgiveness for syntax slips, light or no type checking, automatic memory management and automatic concurrency—all features that seem to speed up development, but could just as well be used for sloppy, error-prone, hard-to-debug, and hard-to-fix code, slowing down development in the long run. If you’re reading this article, then your goal is likely not to create a quick demo, but a stable application with a long, evolving life span.

How to identify your scalability bottlenecks? You can create simulations and measurements of scalability rather than performance. You need to model actual user behavior patterns, allow for a diversity of such behaviors to happen concurrently, and replicate this diversity on a massive scale.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Creating such a simulation is a difficult and expensive, as is monitoring and interpreting the results and identifying potential bottlenecks. This is the main reason for the lack of good data and good judgment about how to scale. Most of what we know comes from tweaking real live web sites, which either comes at the expense of user experience, or allows for very limited experimentation. Your best bet is to hire a team who’s already been through this before.

</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
In summary, your architectural objective is to increase concurrency, not necessarily performance. Optimizing for concurrency means breaking up tasks into as many pieces as possible, and possibly even breaking requests into smaller pieces. We’ll cover numerous strategies here, from frontend to backend. Meanwhile, feel free to frame these inspirational slogans on your wall:
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
Requests are hot potatoes: Pass them on!

<div class="Unindented">
And:

<blockquote class="Quote">
It’s better to have many short requests than one long one.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-88"></a>Caching<a class="Label" name="../scaling/|caching"> </a><a class="Label" name="../../scaling/|caching"> </a>
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Retrieving from a cache can be orders of magnitude faster than dynamically processing a request. It’s your most powerful tool for increasing concurrency.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Caching, however, is only effective is there’s something in the cache. It’s pointless to cache fragments that appear only to one user on only one page that they won’t return to. On the other hand, there may very well be fragments on the page that will recur often. If you design your page carefully to allow for fragmentation, you will reap the benefits of fine-grained caching. Remember, though, that the outermost fragment’s expiration defines the expiration of the included fragments. It’s thus good practice to define no caching on the page itself, and only to cache fragments.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In your plan for fine-grained caching, take special care to isolate those fragments that cannot be cached, and cache everything around them.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Make sure to change Prudence’s <u>cache key (page <a class="Reference" href="#../manual/api/|document-cache-key-pattern">1↑</a>)</u> to fit the lowest common denominator: you want as many possible requests to use the already-cached data, rather than generating new data. Note that, by default, Prudence includes the request URI in the cache key . Fragments, though, may very well appear identically in many different URIs. You would thus not want the URI as part of their cache key.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Cache aggressively, but also take cache validation seriously. Make good use of Prudence’s <u>cache tags (page <a class="Reference" href="#../manual/api/|document-cache-tags">1↑</a>)</u> to allow you to invalidate portions of the cache that should be updated as data changes. Note, though, that every time you invalidate you will lose caching benefits. If possible, make sure that your cache tags don’t cover too many pages. Invalidate only those entries that really need to be invalidated.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
(It’s sad that many popular web sites do cache validation so poorly. Users have come to expect that sometimes they see wrong, outdated data on a page, sometimes mixed with up-to-date data. The problem is usually solved within minutes, or after a few browser refreshes, but please do strive for a better user experience in your web site!)
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you’re using a <u>deferred task handler (page <a class="Reference" href="#../scaling/|deferrable-tasks">1↓</a>)</u>, you might want to invalidate tagged cache entries when tasks are done. Consider creating a special internal API that lets the task handler call back to your application to do this.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
How long should you cache? As long as the user can bear! In a perfect world, of limitless computing resources, all pages would always be generated freshly per request. In a great many cases, however, there is no harm at all if users see some data that’s a few hours or a few days old.
</div>

Note that even very small cache durations can make a big difference in application stability. Consider it the maximum throttle for load. For example, a huge sudden peak of user load, or even a denial-of-service (DOS) attack, might overrun your thread pool.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-137"></a>Cache Warming
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Caches work best when they are ‘‘warm,’’ meaning that they are full of data ready to be retrieved.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A ‘‘cold’’ cache is not only useless, but it can also lead indirectly to a serious problem. If your site has been optimized for a warm cache, starting from cold could significantly strain your performance, as your application servers struggle to generate all pages and fragments from scratch. Users would be getting slow response times until the cache is significantly warm. Worse, your system could crash under the sudden extra load.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
There are two strategies to deal with cold caches. The first is to allow your cache to be persistent, so that if you restart the cache system it retains the same warmth it had before. This happens automatically with <u>database-backed caches (page <a class="Reference" href="#../scaling/|cache-backends">1↓</a>)</u>. The second strategy is to deliberately warm up the cache in preparation for user requests.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Consider creating a special external process or processes to do so. Here are some tips:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
Consider mechanisms to make sure that your warmer does not overload your system or take too much bandwidth from actual users. The best warmers are adaptive, changing their load according to what the servers can handle. Otherwise, consider shutting down your site for a certain amount of time until the cache is sufficiently warm.
</li>
<li>
If the scope is very large, you will have to pick and choose which pages to warm up. You would want to choose only the most popular pages, in which case you might need a system to record and measure popularity. For example, for a blog, it’s not enough just to warm up, say, the last two weeks of blog posts, because a blog post from a year ago might be very popular at the moment. Effective warming would require you to find out how many times certain blog posts were hit in the past two weeks. It might make sense to embed this auditing ability into the cache backend itself.
</li>
</ol>

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection*-1"></a>Pre-Filling the Cache
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
If there are thousands of ways in which users can organize a data view, and each of these views is particular to one user, then it may make little sense to cache them individually, because individual schemes would hardly ever be re-used. You’ll just be filling up the cache with useless entries.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Take a closer look, though:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
It may be that of the thousands of organization schemes only a few are commonly used, so it’s worth caching the output of just those.
</li>
<li>
It could be that these schemes are similar enough to each other that you could generate them all in one operation, and save them each separately in the cache. Even if cache entries will barely be used, if they’re cheap to create, it still might be worth creating them.
</li>
</ol>
<div class="Unindented">
This leads us to an important point:
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
Prudence is a ‘‘frontend’’ platform, in that it does not specify which data backend, if at all, you should use. Its cache, however, is general purpose, and you can store in it anything that you can encode as a string.
</blockquote>
<div class="Unindented">
Let’s take as a pre-filling example a tree data structure in which branches can be visually opened and closed. Additionally, according to user permissions different parts of the tree may be hidden. Sounds too complicated to cache all the view combinations? Well, consider that you can trigger, upon any change to the tree data structure, a function that loops through all the different iterations of the tree recursively and saves a view of each of them to the cache. The cache keys can be something like ‘‘branch1+.branch2-.branch3+’’, with ‘‘+’’ signifying ‘‘-’’ whether the branch is visually open or closed. You can use similar +’s and -’s for permissions, and create views per permission combinations. Later, when users with specific permissions request different views of the tree, no problem: all possibilities were already pre-filled. You might end up having to generate and cache thousands of views at once, but the difference between generating one view and generating thousands of views may be quite small, because the majority of the duration is spend communicating with the database backend. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If generating thousands of views takes too long for the duration of a single request, another option is to generate them on a separate thread. Even if it takes a few minutes to generate all the many, many tree views combinations, it might be OK in your application for views to be a few minutes out-of-date. Consider that the scalability benefits can be very significant: you generate views only <i>once </i>for the entire system, while millions of concurrent users do a simple retrieval from the cache.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection*-2"></a>Caching the Data Backend
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Pre-filling the cache can take you very far. It is, however, quite complicated to implement, and can be ineffective if data changes too frequently or if the cache has to constantly be updated. Also, it’s hard to scale the pre-filling to <i>millions </i>of fragments.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If we go back to our tree example above, the problem was that it was too costly to fetch the entire tree from the database. But what if we cache the tree itself? In that case, it would be very quick to generate any view of the tree on-demand. Instead of caching the view, we’d be caching the data, and achieving the same scalability gains.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Easy, right? So why not cache <i>all</i> our data structures? The reason is that it’s very difficult to do this correctly beyond trivial examples. Data structures tend to have complex interrelationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, foreign keys, recursive tree structures, graphs, etc.) such that a change in data at one point of the structure may alter various others in particular ways. For example, consider a calendar database, and that you’re caching individual days with all their events. Weekly calendar views are then generated on the fly (and quickly) for users according to what kinds of events they want to see in their personal calendars. What happens if a user adds a recurring event that happens every Monday? You’ll need to make sure that all Mondays currently cached would be invalidated, which might mean tagging all these as ‘‘monday’’ using Prudence’s cache tags. This requires a specific caching strategy for a specific application.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
By all means, cache your data structures if you can’t easily cache your output, but be aware of the challenge!
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
Prudence’s sister project, Diligence, is designed specifically to solve this problem.

</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Your cache backend can become a bottleneck to scalability if 1) it can’t handle the amount of data you are storing, or 2) it can’t respond quickly enough to cache fetching. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Before you start worrying about this, consider that it’s a rare problem to have. Even if you are caching millions of pages and fragments, a simple relational-database-backed cache, such as Prudence’s SqlCache implementations, could handle this just fine. A key/value table is the most trivial workload for relational databases, and it’s also easy to <u>shard (page <a class="Reference" href="#../scaling/|by-section">1↓</a>)</u>. Relational database are usually very good at caching these tables in their memory and responding optimally to read requests. Prudence even lets you chain caches together to create tiers: an in-process memory cache in front of a SQL cache would ensure that many requests don’t even reach the SQL backend.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
High concurrency can also be handled very well by this solution. Despite any limits to the number of concurrent connections you can maintain to the database, each request is handled very quickly, and it would require <i>very </i>high loads to saturate. The math is straightforward: with a 10ms average retrieval time (very pessimistic!) and a maximum of 10 concurrent database connections (again, pessimistic!) you can handle 1,000 cache hits per second. A real environment would likely provide results orders of magnitude better.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The nice thing about this solution is that it uses the infrastructure you already have: the database.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
But, what if you need to handle <i>millions</i> of cache hits per second? First, let us congratulate you for your global popularity. Second, there is a simple solution: distributed memory caches. Prudence comes with <a class="URL" href="http://www.hazelcast.com/">Hazelcast</a> and support for <a class="URL" href="http://memcached.org/">memcached</a>, which both offer much better scalability than database backends. Because the cache is in memory, you lose the ability to easily persist your cache and keep it warm: restarting your cache nodes will effectively reset them. There are workarounds—for example, parts of the cache can be persisted to a second database-backed cache tier—but this is a significant feature to lose.
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
Actually, Hazelcast offers fail-safe, live backups. While it’s not quite as permanent as a database, it might be good enough for your needs. And memcached has various plugins that allow for real database persistence, though using them would require you to deal with the scalability challenges of <u>database backends (page <a class="Reference" href="#../scaling/|data-backends">1↓</a>)</u>.
</blockquote>
<div class="Unindented">
You’ll see many web frameworks out there that support a distributed memory cache (usually memcached) and recommend you use it (‘‘it’s fast!’’ they claim, except that it can be slower per request than optimized databases, and that anyway performance does not equal scalability). We’d urge you to consider that advice carefully: keeping your cache warm is a challenge made much easier if you can store it in a persistent backend, and database backends can take you very far in scale without adding a new infrastructure to your deployment. It’s good to know, though, that Prudence’s support for Hazelcast and memcached is there to help you in case you reach the popularity levels of LiveJournal, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-139"></a>Client-Side Caching
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Modern web browsers support client-side caching, a feature meant to improve the user experience and save bandwidth costs. A site that makes good use of client-side caching will appear to work fast for users, and will also help to increase your site’s popularity index with search engines.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Optimizing the user experience is not the topic of this article: our job here is to make sure your site doesn’t degrade its performance as load increases. However, client-side caching can indirectly help you scale by reducing the number of hits you have to take in order for your application to work.
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
Actually, doing a poor job with client-side caching can help you scale: users will hate your site and stop using it—voila, less hits you have to deal with. OK, that was a joke!
</blockquote>
<div class="Unindented">
Generally, Prudence handles client-side caching automatically. If you cache a page, then headers will be set to ask the client to cache for the same length of time. By default, conditional mode is used: every time the client tries to view a page, it will make a request to make sure that nothing has changed since their last request to the page. In case nothing has changed, no content is returned.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You can also turn on ‘‘offline caching’’ mode, in which the client will avoid even that quick request. Why not enable offline caching by default? Because it involves some risk: if you ask to cache a page for one week, but then find out that you have a mistake in your application, then users will not see any fix you publish until their local cache expires, which can take up to a week! It’s important that you you understand the implications before using this mode. See the <u>dynamicWebClientCachingMode application setting (page <a class="Reference" href="#../manual/application/|dynamic-web-client-caching-mode">1↑</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
It’s generally safer to apply offline caching to your static resources, such as graphics and other resources. A general custom is to ask the client to cache these ‘‘forever’’ (10 years), and then, if you need to update a file, you simply create a new one with a new URL, and have all your HTML refer to the new version. Because clients cache according to URL, their cached for the old version will simply not be ignored. See <u>CacheControlFilter (page <a class="Reference" href="#../manual/static-web/|cache-control-filter">1↑</a>)</u>. There, you’ll also see some more tricks Prudence offers you to help optimize the user experience, such as unifying/minimizing client-side JavaScript and CSS.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-140"></a>Upstream Caching
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
If you need to quickly scale a web site that has not been designed for caching, a band-aid is available: upstream caches, such as <a class="URL" href="http://varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a>, <a class="URL" href="http://code.google.com/p/ncache/">NCache</a> and even <a class="URL" href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid</a>. For archaic reasons, these are called ‘‘reverse proxy’’ caches, but they really work more like filters. According to attributes in the user request (URL, cookies, etc.), they decide whether to fetch and send a cached version of the response, or to allow the request to continue to your application servers.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The crucial use case is archaic, too. If you’re using an old web framework in which you cannot implement caching logic yourself, or cannot plug in to a good cache backend, then these upstream caches can do it for you.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
They are problematic in two ways:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
Decoupling caching logic from your application means losing many features. For example, invalidating portions of the cache is difficult if not impossible. It’s because of upstream caching, indeed, that so many web sites do a poor job at showing up-to-date information.
</li>
<li>
Filtering actually implements a kind of partitioning, but one that is vertical rather than horizontal. In horizontal partitioning, a ‘‘switch’’ decides to send requests to one cluster of servers or another. Within each cluster, you can control capacity and scale. But in vertical partitioning, the ‘‘filter’’ handles requests internally. Not only is the ‘‘filter’’ more complex and vulnerable than a ‘‘switch’’ as a frontend connector to the world, but you’ve also complicated your ability to control the capacity of the caching layer. It’s embedded inside your frontend, rather than being another cluster of servers. We’ll delve into <u>backend partitioning (page <a class="Reference" href="#../scaling/|backend-partitioning">1↓</a>)</u> below.
</li>
</ol>
<div class="Unindented">
Unfortunately, there is a use case relevant for newer web frameworks, too: if you’ve designed your application poorly, and you have many requests that could take a long time to complete, then your thread pools could get saturated when many users are concurrently making those requests. When saturated, you cannot handle even the super-quick cache requests. An upstream cache band-aid could, at least, keep serving its cached pages, even though your application servers are at full capacity. This creates an illusion of scalability: some users will see your web site behaving fine, while others will see it hanging.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The real solution would be to re-factor your application so that it does not have long requests, guaranteeing that you’re never too saturated to handle tiny requests. Below are tips on how to do this.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-89"></a>Dealing with Lengthy Requests
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
One size does not fit all: you will want to use different strategies to deal with different kinds of tasks.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-141"></a>Necessary Tasks
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
<i>The user can’t continue without the task being resolved.</i>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If the necessary task is deterministically fast, you can do all processing in the request itself.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If not, you should queue the task on a handling service and return a ‘‘please wait’’ page to the user. It would be nice to add a progress bar or some other kind of estimation of how long it would take for the task to be done. The client will poll until the task status is marked ‘‘done,’’ after which they will be redirected somewhere else. Each polling request sent by the client could likely be processed very quickly, so this this strategy effectively breaks the task into many small requests (‘‘It’s better to have many short requests than one long one’’).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Implementing a handling service is by no means trivial. It adds a new component to your architecture, one that also has to be made to scale. One can also argue that it adversely affects user experience by adding overhead, delaying the time it takes for the task to complete. The bottom line, though, is you’re vastly increasing concurrency and your ability to scale. And, you’re actually improving the user experience: they would get a feedback on what’s going on rather than having their browsers spin, waiting for their requests to complete.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-142"></a>Deferrable Tasks<a class="Label" name="../scaling/|deferrable-tasks"> </a>
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
<i>It’s OK if the task occurs later.</i>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
As with necessary tasks, you can queue these with a task handling service, but it’s much simpler because you don’t have to keep track of status or display it to the user. This allows you to use a simpler—and more scalable—task handling service.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Deferring tasks does present a challenge to the user experience: What do you do if the task fails, and the user needs to know about it? One solution can be to send a warning email or other kind of message to the user. Another solution could be to have your client constantly poll in the background (via ‘‘AJAX’’) to see if there are any error messages, which in turn might require you to keep a queue of such error messages per user.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Before you decide on deferring a task, think carefully of the user experience: for example, users might be constantly refreshing a web page waiting to see the results of their operation. Perhaps the task you thought you can defer should actually be considered necessary?
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Prudence lets you easily defer work internally via <u>tasks (page <a class="Reference" href="#../manual/tasks/">1↑</a>)</u>. In particular, you can spawn a task dynamically to do work without tying up the current thread. Also, Prudence comes with <a class="URL" href="http://www.hazelcast.com/">Hazelcast</a>, which is used for an optional <u>distributed cache backend (page <a class="Reference" href="#../scaling/|cache-backends">1↑</a>)</u>, but also has excellent support for handling distributed task queues.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-143"></a>File Uploads
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
These are potentially very long requests that you cannot break into smaller tasks, because they depend entirely on the client. As such, they present a unique challenge to scalability.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Fortunately, Prudence handles client requests via non-blocking I/O, meaning that large file uploads will not hold on to a single thread for the duration of the upload. See <u>conversation.form (page <a class="Reference" href="#../manual/api/|conversation-form">1↑</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Unfortunately, many concurrent uploads will still saturate your threads. If your application relies on frequent file uploads, you are advised to handle such requests on separate Prudence instances, so that uploads won’t stop your application from handling other web requests. You may also consider using a third-party service specializing in file storage and web uploads.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-144"></a>Asynchronous Request Processing
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Having the client poll until a task is completed lets you break up a task into multiple requests and increase concurrency. Another strategy is to break an <i>individual request</i> into pieces. While you’re processing the request and preparing the response, you can free the web thread to handle other requests. When you’re ready to deliver content, you raise a signal, and the next available web thread takes care of sending your response to the client. You can continue doing this indefinitely until the response is complete. From the client’s perspective it’s a single request: a web browser, for example, would spin until the request was completed.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You might be adding some extra time overhead for the thread-switching on your end, but the benefits for scalability are obvious: you are increasing concurrency by shortening the time you are holding on to web threads.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For web services that deliver heavy content, such as images, video, audio, it’s absolutely necessary. Without it, a single user could tie up a thread for minutes, if not hours. You would still get degraded performance if you have more concurrent users than you have threads, but at least degradation will be shared among users. Without asynchronous processing, each user would tie up one thread, and when that finite resource is used up, more users won’t be able to access your service.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Even for lightweight content such as HTML web pages, asynchronous processing can be a good tactic for increasing concurrency. For example, if you need to fetch data from a backend with non-deterministic response time, it’s best to free the web thread until you actually have content available for the response.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
It’s not a good idea to do this for every page. While it’s better to have many short requests instead of one long one, it’s obviously better to have one short request rather than many short ones. Which web requests are good candidates for asynchronous processing?
</div>
<ol>

<li>
Requests for which processing is made of independent operations. (They’ll likely be required to work in sequence, but if they can be processed in parallel, even better!)
</li>
<li>
Requests that must access backend services with non-deterministic response times.
</li>
</ol>
<div class="Unindented">
And, even for #2, if the service can take a <i>very</i> long time to respond, consider that it might be better to queue the task on a task handler and give proper feedback to the user.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
And so, after this lengthy discussion, it turns out that there aren’t that many places where asynchronous processing can help you scale. Caching is far more useful.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
As of version 1.0, Prudence has limited support for asynchronous processing, via <u>conversation.defer (page <a class="Reference" href="#../manual/api/|conversation-defer">1↑</a>)</u>. Better support is planned for a future version.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-90"></a>Backend Partitioning<a class="Label" name="../scaling/|backend-partitioning"> </a>
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
You can keep adding more nodes behind a load balancer insofar as each request does not have to access shared state. Useful web applications, however, are likely data-driven, requiring considerable state.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If the challenge in handling web requests is cutting down the length of request, then that of backends is the struggle against degraded performance as you add new nodes to your database cluster. These nodes have to synchronize their state with each other, and that synchronization overhead increases exponentially. There’s a definite point of diminishing returns.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The backend is one place where high-performance hardware can help. Ten expensive, powerful machines might be equal in total power to forty cheap machines, but they require a quarter of the synchronization overhead, giving you more elbow room to scale up. Fewer nodes is better.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
But CPUs can only take you so far.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Partitioning is as useful to backend scaling as caching is to web request scaling. Rather than having one big cluster of identical nodes, you would have several smaller, independent clusters. This lets you add nodes to each cluster without spreading synchronization overhead everywhere. The more partitions you can create, the better you’ll be able to scale.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Partitioning can happen in various components of your application, such as application servers, the caching system, task queues, etc. However, it is most effective, and most complicated to implement, for databases. Our discussion will thus focus on relational (SQL) databases. Other systems would likely require simpler subsets of these strategies.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-145"></a>Reads vs. Writes
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This simple partitioning scheme greatly reduces synchronization overhead. Read-only servers will never send data to the writable servers. Also, knowing that they don’t have to handle writes means you can optimize their configurations for aggressive caching.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
(In fact, some database synchronization systems will only let you create this kind of cluster, providing you with one ‘‘master’’ writable node and several read-only ‘‘slaves.’’ They force you to partition!)
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Another nice thing about read/write partitioning is that you can easily add it to all the other strategies. Any cluster can thus be divided into two.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Of course, for web services that are heavily balanced towards writes, this is not an effective strategy. For example, if you are implementing an auditing service that is constantly being bombarded by incoming data, but is only queried once in a while, then an extra read-only node won’t help you scale.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Note that one feature you lose is the ability to have a transaction in which a write <i>might</i> happen, because a transaction cannot contain both a read-only node and a write-only node. If you must have atomicity, you will have to do your transaction on the writable cluster, or have two transactions: one to lookup and see if you need to change the data, and the second to perform the change—while first checking again that data didn’t change since the previous transaction. Too much of this obviously lessens the effectiveness of read/write partitioning.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-146"></a>By Feature
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
The most obvious and effective partitioning scheme is by feature. Your site might offer different kinds of services that are functionally independent of each other, even though they are displayed to users as united. Behind the scenes, each feature uses a different set of tables. The rule of thumb is trivial: if you can put the tables in separate databases, then you can put these databases in separate clusters.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
One concern in feature-based partitioning is that there are a few tables that still need to be shared. For example, even though the features are separate, they all depend on user settings that are stored in one table.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The good news is that it can be cheap to synchronize just this one table between all clusters. Especially if this table doesn’t change often—how often do you get new users signing up for your service?—then synchronization overhead will be minimal.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If your database system doesn’t let you synchronize individual tables, then you can do it in your code by writing to all clusters at the same time.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Partitioning by feature is terrific in that it lets you partition other parts of the stack, too. For example, you can also use a different set of web servers for each feature.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Also consider that some features might be candidates for using a <u>‘‘NoSQL’’ database (page <a class="Reference" href="#../scaling/|data-backends">1↓</a>)</u>. Choose the best backend per feature.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-147"></a>By Section<a class="Label" name="../scaling/|by-section"> </a>
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Another kind of partitioning is sometimes called ‘‘sharding.’’ It involves splitting up tables into sections that can be placed in different databases. Some databases support sharding as part of their synchronization strategy, but you can also implement it in your code. The great thing about sharding is that it lets you create as many shards (and clusters) as you want. It’s the key to the truly large scale.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Unfortunately, like partitioning by feature, sharding is not always possible. You need to also shard all related tables, so that queries can be self-contained within each shard. It’s thus most appropriate for one-to-many data hierarchies. For example, if your application is a blog that supports comments, then you put some blogs and their comments on one shard, and others in another shard. However, if, say, you have a feature where blog posts can refer to other arbitrary blog posts, then querying for those would have to cross shard boundaries.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The best way to see where sharding is possible is to draw a diagram of your table relationships. Places in the diagram which look like individual trees—trunks spreading out into branches and twigs—are good candidates for sharding.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
How to decide which data goes in which shard?
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Sometimes the best strategy is arbitrary. For example, put all the even-numbered IDs in one shard, and the odd-numbered ones in another. This allows for straightforward growth because you can just switch it to division by three if you want three shards. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Another strategy might seem obvious: If you’re running a site which shows different sets of data to different users, then why not implement it as essentially separate sites? For example, a social networking site strictly organized around individual cities could have separate database clusters per city.

A ‘‘region’’ can be geographical, but also topical. For example, a site hosting dance-related discussion forums might have one cluster for ballet and one for tango. A ‘‘region’’ can also refer to user types. For example, your social networking site could be partitioned according to age groups.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The only limitation is queries. You can still let users access profiles in other regions, but cross-regional relational queries won’t be possible. Depending on what your application does, this could be a reasonable solution.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A great side-benefit to geographical partitioning is that you can host your servers at data centers within the geographical location, leading to better user experiences. Regional partitioning is useful even for ‘‘NoSQL’’ databases.

<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection*-3"></a>Coding Tips for Partitioning
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
If you organize your code well, it would be very easy to implement partitioning. You simply assign different database operations to use different connection pools. If it’s by feature, then you can hard code it for those features. If it’s sharding, then you add a switch before each operation telling it which connection pool to use.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">def get_blogger_profile(user_id):
	connection = blogger_pool.get_connection()
	...
	connection.close()
​
def get_blog_post_and_comments(blog_post_id):
	shard_id = object.id % 3
	connection = blog_pools[shard_id].get_connection()
	...
	connection.close()
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Unfortunately, some programming practices make such an effective, clean organization difficult.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Some developers prefer to use ORMs (object-relational mappers) rather than access the database directly. Many ORMs do not easily allow for partitioning, either because they support only a single database connection pool, or because they don’t allow your objects to be easily shared between connections.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For example, your logic might require you to retrieve an ‘‘object’’ from the database, and only then decide if you need to alter it or not. If you’re doing read/write partitioning, then you obviously want to read from the read partition. Some ORMs, though, have the object tied so strongly to an internal connection object that you can’t trivially read it from one connection and save it into another. You’d either have to read the object initially from the write partition, minimizing the usefulness of read/write partitioning, or re-read it from the write partition when you realize you need to alter it, causing unnecessary overhead. (Note that you’ll need to do this anyway if you need the write to happen in a transaction.)
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Object oriented design is also problematic in a more general sense. The first principle of object orientation is ‘‘encapsulation,’’ putting your code and data structure in one place: the class. This might make sense for business logic, but, for the purposes of re-factoring your data backend for partitioning or other strategies, you really don’t want the data access code to be spread out among dozens of classes in your application. You want it all in one place, preferably even one source code file. It would let you plug in a whole new data backend strategy by replacing this source code file. For data-driven web development, you are better off not being too object oriented.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Even more generally speaking, organizing code together by mechanism or technology, rather than by ‘‘object’’ encapsulation, will let you apply all kinds of re-factorizations more easily, especially if you manage to decouple your application’s data structures from any library-specific data structures.

Relational (SQL) databases such as MySQL were, for decades, the backbone of the web. They were originally developed as minimal alternatives to enterprise database servers such as Oracle Database and IBM’s DB2. Their modest feature set allowed for better performance, smaller footprints, and low investment costs—perfect for web applications. The free software LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) <i>was</i> the web.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Relational databases require a lot of synchronization overhead for clusters, limiting their scalability. Though partitioning can take you far, using a ‘‘NoSQL’’ database could take you even further.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-148"></a>Graph Databases
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
If your relational data structure contains arbitrary-depth relationships or many ‘‘generic’’ relationships forced into a relational model, then consider using a graph database instead. Not only will traversing your data be faster, but also the database structure will allow for more efficient performance. The implications for scalability can be dramatic.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Social networking applications are often used as examples of graph structures, but there are many others: forums with threaded and cross-referenced discussions, semantic knowledge bases, warehouse and parts management, music ‘‘genomes,’’ user-tagged media sharing sites, and many science and engineering applications.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Though fast, querying a complex graph can be difficult to prototype. Fortunately, the <a class="URL" href="http://wiki.github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/">Gremlin</a> and <a class="URL" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">SPARQL</a> languages do for graphs what SQL does for relational databases. Your query becomes coherent and portable.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A popular graph database is <a class="URL" href="http://neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a>, and it’s especially easy to use with Prudence. Because it’s JVM-based, you can access it internally from Prudence. It also has embedded bindings for many of Prudence’s supported languages, and supports a network REST interface which you can easily access via Prudence’s document.external.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-149"></a>Document Databases
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
If your data contains mostly ‘‘documents’’—self-contained records with few relationships to other documents—then consider a document database. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Document databases allow for straightforward distribution and very fine-grained replication, requiring considerably less overhead than relational and graph databases. Document databases are as scalable as data storage gets: variants are used by all the super-massive Internet services.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The cost of this scalability is the loss of your ability to do relational queries of your data. Instead, you’ll be using distributed map/reduce, or rely on an external indexing service. These are powerful tools, but they do not match relational queries in sheer speed of complex queries. Implementing something as simple as a many-to-many connection, the bread-and-butter of relational databases, requires some specialization. Document databases shine at listing, sorting and searching through extremely large catalogs of documents.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Candidate applications include online retail, blogs, wikis, archives, newspapers, contact lists, calendars, photo galleries, dating profiles… This is a long list, but by no means exhaustive of all that is possible in web applications. Many useful applications cannot be reduced to sets of lightly interconnected ‘‘documents’’ without giving up a lot of useful functionality. For example, merely adding social networking capabilities to a dating site would require complex relations that might be better handled with a graph database.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A popular document database is <a class="URL" href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>. Though document-based, it has a few basic relational features that might be just good enough for your needs. Another is <a class="URL" href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>, which is a truly distributed database. With CouchDB it’s trivial to replicate and synchronize data with clients’ desktops or mobile devices, and to distribute it to partners. It also supports a REST interface which you can easily access via Prudence’s document.external. And, both MongoDB and CouchDB use JavaScript extensively, making it natural to use with Prudence’s JavaScript flavor.
</div>

<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-150"></a>Column Databases
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
These can be considered as subsets of document databases. The ‘‘document,’’ in this case, is required to have an especially simple, one-dimensional structure.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This requirement allows optimization for a truly massive scale.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Column databases occupy the ‘‘cloud’’ market niche: they allow massive companies like Google and Amazon to cheaply offer database storage and services for third parties. See Google’s <a class="URL" href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/">Datastore</a> (based on <a class="URL" href="http://labs.google.com/papers/bigtable.html">Bigtable</a>) and Amazon’s <a class="URL" href="http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/">SimpleDB</a> (based on <a class="URL" href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/10/amazons_dynamo.html">Dynamo</a>; actually, Dynamo is a ‘‘key/value’’ database, which is even more opaque than a column database).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Though you can run your own column database via open source projects like <a class="URL" href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a> (originally developed by/for Facebook) and <a class="URL" href="http://hadoop.apache.org/hbase/">HBase</a>, the document databases mentioned above offer richer document structures and more features. Consider column databases only if you need truly massive scale, or if you want to make use of the cheap storage offered by ‘‘cloud’’ vendors.

Prudence brings together many open source libraries, some of which were designed specifically for Prudence.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Consider this as Prudence’s ‘‘acknowledgments’’ page. Hundreds of people have worked on these libraries, and we’re grateful to all of them for sharing their hard work, for embracing open source licensing, and for adhering to design principles that allow reuse of their work in other projects, such as Prudence.

</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
How wonderful that the best-performing, most robust, secure and widely ported virtual machine is now open source? How wonderful that you can use it with JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Clojure, PHP and others languages?
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We strongly recommend the JVM for enterprise and scalable Internet applications, even if you’re not particularly fond of Java-the-programming-language. Treat Java, if you will, as the low machine-level language: Java is to the JVM as C is to Unix. You ‘‘drop down’’ to Java only if you have to do some machine-level work. Otherwise, use the higher-level languages.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-93"></a>Scripturian
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
<a class="URL" href="http://threecrickets.com/scripturian/">Scripturian</a> is Prudence’s ‘‘special sauce’’: a small, magical library that makes sure that your code runs well on the JVM and can handle the concurrency introduced by HTTP requests and Restlet. It is developed in tandem with Prudence.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Our premise was this: to make Prudence applications easy to deploy, they could not be standard Java applications. The cycle of compilation and packaging required by Java is unnecessarily cumbersome. Although we could have implemented something like the on-the-fly Java compilation done in JSP, we felt that, if that’s the route to go, many exciting choices open up besides Java, and that these languages are more relevant to Prudence’s goals.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Unfortunately, we found that integrating JVM languages into Prudence was anything but trivial. Each implementation had its own idea of what integration could mean. We tried to standardize on <a class="URL" href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/scripting/">JSR-223 (the Java scripting standard)</a>, but found that adherence to the specification was inconsistent, and that the specification itself is vague, especially when it comes to threading. We hacked and hacked and hacked. We even submitted patches to fix broken implementations of various languages. All in all, we probably spent more time on this than on any other aspect of Prudence.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The result is an API more abstract than JSR-223, but with a clear threading model. Under the hood, Scripturian contains many tricks and mechanisms to make each language work correctly and well, but you don’t have to worry about any of it: Scripturian just works.

<div class="Indented">
These open source language engines have allowed us to extend the power of Prudence, REST and the JVM to languages outside of Java. Some of these engines are large, complex projects, and are in fact the biggest libraries included in Prudence. We strongly recommend you join in the communities surrounding the language engines corresponding to your favorite flavor of Prudence.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-95"></a>Restlet
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Prudence went through many in-house transformations before aligning itself strongly with Restlet. First, we experimented with <a class="URL" href="https://facelets.dev.java.net/">Facelets</a>, but ended up giving up on <a class="URL" href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/">JSF</a>, its complex lifecycle, and on the promise of component-based web development in general. Then, we designed REST architectures using servlets and <a class="URL" href="http://threecrickets.com/succinct/">Succinct</a> templates, but found it awkward to force servlets into a REST architecture. Discovering <a class="URL" href="http://www.restlet.org/">Restlet</a> was a breath of fresh air.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Restlet’s super-powers are three:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
It’s a clean abstraction of HTTP requests, responses and headers over best-of-breed HTTP engines, such as <a class="URL" href="http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/">Jetty</a>, <a class="URL" href="https://grizzly.dev.java.net/">Grizzly</a> and <a class="URL" href="http://www.jboss.org/netty">Netty</a>. Automatically gain the scalable advantages of non-blocking I/O and even asynchronous request handling (which will be even better supported in Restlet 2.1). Restlet transparently handles conditional requests, content negotiation, and other complicated HTTP mechanisms.
</li>
<li>
Powerful URI routing and manipulation. Expose your service to users and APIs with elegance and coherence. Make sure the URI reaches its destination, with support for virtual hosting, rewriting, templating, and other useful real-world features. Restlet is truly the Swiss army knife of URIs.
</li>
<li>
Straightforward data representation and consumption through a diverse set of extensions. Expose your data using any standard format, and even convert it on the fly. Easily parse data received from clients.
</li>
</ol>
<div class="Unindented">
Restlet is a great library, with a great ecosystem of extensions. In embracing it, though, we missed some of the advantages of having a servlet container: easy deployment and configuration, centralized logging, etc. We also missed having JSP at our fingertips to quickly push out dynamic HTML.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Prudence is meant to fill in these gaps.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Special thanks go to <a class="URL" href="http://www.noelios.com/">Noelios</a>, and especially Jérôme Louvel, for cultivating such a vibrant community around Restlet. It’s a solid foundation.

<div class="Unindented">
<a class="URL" href="http://threecrickets.com/succinct/">Succinct</a>, like Scripturian, started as a part of Prudence, and was in fact one of its earliest components. It has since branched out into an independent library. We created it because we wanted straightforward, scalable templating built in to Prudence, and were unsatisfied by other open source offerings. We think you might like it. (If not, Prudence fully supports <a class="URL" href="http://velocity.apache.org/">Velocity</a>.)

</h2>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-152"></a>Why are plural URL forms for aggregate resources (/animal/cats/) preferred over singular forms (/animal/cat/)?
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
You’ll see RESTful implementations that use either convention. The advantage of using the singular form is that you have less addresses, and what some people would call a more elegant scheme:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">/animal/cat/12 -&gt; Just one cat
/animal/cat/ -&gt; All cats
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Why add another URL when a single one is enough to do the work?  One reason is that you can help the client avoid potential errors. For example, the client probably uses a variable to hold the ID of the cat and then constructs the URL dynamically. But, what if the client forgets to check for null IDs? It might then construct a URL in the form ‘‘/animal/cat//’’ which would then successfully access <i>all</i> cats. This can cause unintended consequences and be difficult to debug. If, however, we used this scheme:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">/animal/cat/12 -&gt; Just one cat
/animal/cats/ -&gt; All cats
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
…then the form ‘‘/animal/cat//’’ would route to our singular cat resource, which would indeed not find the cat and return the expected, debuggable 404 error. From this example, we can extract a good rule of thumb: clearly separate URLs at their base by usage, so that mistakes cannot happen. More addresses means more debuggability.

That’s not very reassuring, but it’s a fact of software and hardware architecture right now. Achieving massive scale is challenging.

</h2>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-155"></a>How well does Prudence perform? How well does it scale?
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
First, recognize that there are two common uses for the term ‘‘scale.’’ REST is often referred to as an inherently scalable architecture, but that has more to do with project management than technical performance. This difference is addressed in the <u>‘‘The Case for REST’’ (page <a class="Reference" href="#../rest/">1↑</a>)</u>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
From the perspective of the ability to respond to user requests, there are three aspects to consider: 
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-123"></a>1. Serving HTTP
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
Prudence comes with <a class="URL" href="http://www.mortbay.org/jetty/">Jetty</a>, an HTTP server based on the JVM’s non-blocking I/O API. Jetty handles concurrent HTTP requests very well, and serves static files at scales comparable to popular HTTP servers.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-124"></a>2. Generating HTML
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
Prudence implements what might be the most sophisticated caching system of any web development framework. Caching is truly the key to scalable software. See <u>‘‘Scaling Tips’’ (page <a class="Reference" href="#../scaling/|caching">1↑</a>)</u> for a comprehensive discussion.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-125"></a>3. Running code
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
There may be a delay when starting up a specific language engine in Prudence for the first time in an application, as it loads and initializes itself. Then, there may be a delay when accessing a dynamic web page or resource for the first time, or after it has been changed, as it might require compilation. Once it’s up and running, though, your code performs and scale very well—as well as you’ve written it. You need to understand concurrency and make sure you make good choices to handle coordination between threads accessing the same data. If all is good, your code will actually perform better throughout the life of the application. The JVM learns and adapts as it runs, and performance can improve the more the application is used.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
All flavors of Prudence are generally very fast. In some cases, the JVM language implementations are faster than their ‘‘native’’ equivalents. This is demonstrable for Python, Ruby and PHP. The reason is that the JVM, soon reaching version 7, is a very mature virtual machine, and incorporates decades-worth of optimiziations for live production environments.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you are performing CPU-intensive or time-sensitive tasks, then it’s best to profile these code segments precisely. Exact performance characteristics depend on the language and engine used. The <a class="URL" href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/">Bechmarks Game</a> can give you some comparisons of different language engines running high-computation programs. In any case, if you have a piece of intensive code that really needs to perform well, it’s probably best to write it in Java and access it from the your language. You can even write it in C or assembly, and have it linked to Java via JNI.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you’re not doing intensive computation, then don’t worry too much about your language being ‘‘slow.’’ It’s been shown that for the vast majority of web applications, the performance of the web programming language is rarely the bottleneck. The deciding factors are the usually performance of the backend data-driving technologies and architectures.

Prudence uses the Lesser GPL, which has even less restrictions on redistribution than the regular GPL. As long as you do not alter Prudence in any way, you can include Prudence in any product, free or non-free.

In the case of Linux, the GPL has done a wonderful job at convincing vendors to open source their code in order to ship their products with Linux inside. It just doesn’t seem likely that they would do the same for Prudence.
