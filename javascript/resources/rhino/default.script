//
// This script implements and handles a REST resource. Simply put, it is a state,
// addressed by a URL, that responds to verbs. Verbs represent logical operations
// on the state, such as create, read, update and delete (CRUD). They are primitive
// communications, which include very minimal session and no transaction state. As such,
// they are very straightforward to implement, and can lead to very scalable
// applications. 
//
// The exact URL of this resource depends on its its filename and/or its location in
// your directory structure. See your prudence.conf for more information.
