<h2>Supported Scripting Language: Velocity</h2>
<p>
Velocity is not a scripting language, and offers only a few programming constructs. It's designed, instead, to be
a fast templating language, which is what it does best. If you need performance, it's probably better to use
Velocity than the other, fuller scripting languages.
</p><p>
But, with Scripturian, there's no great penalty for the choice. It's very easy to mix in other languages when you need them. The <a href="demos/velocity.page?source=true">source code</a>
for the Velocity demo shows how easy it is to fill in the gaps with JavaScript.
</p><p>
Not only that, but you can insert Velocity scriptlets in the flow the other scripting languages, via Scripturian's
"in-flow" tag. See the <a href="faq.page">FAQ</a> for more information.
</p>

<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
<p>
Get Velocity <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/">here</a>. Note that you also need a small library for
<a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/scripting/">Java scripting standard (JSR-223)</a>, which is available 
at the <a href="https://scripting.dev.java.net/">Java scripting project</a>.
