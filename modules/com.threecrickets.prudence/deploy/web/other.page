<h2>Other Scripting Platforms</h2>
<p>
To add a new language to Scripturian, you will first need to create an <a href="http://www.threecrickets.com/scripturian/api/index.html?com/threecrickets/scripturian/ScriptletParsingHelper.html">ScriptletParsingHelper</a>
for it. This is a small and usually very straightforward class, and can be used to solve problems with the Java scripting standard implementation.  
Our experience has shown that adherence to the Java scripting standard is inconsistent.
In fact, all script engines currently supported by Scripturian required special workarounds.
