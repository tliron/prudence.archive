<h2>Supported Scripting Language: Groovy</h2>
<p>
In many ways, Groovy is the best of this bunch. It has all the flexibility of <a href="ruby.page">Ruby</a>, but is designed from the ground up to integrate
strongly into Java. That means that any Java library is also a Groovy library. (This is true to various extents for the other scripting languages
here, but Groovy does it best.) Additionally, Groovy is enjoying a huge growth in specialized adaptations and Groovy-specific libraries.
</p><p>
If you know your project will involve a lot of Java coding in addition to scripting, Groovy is a terrific choice.

<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
<p>
Groovy is implemented by, well, <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>.
