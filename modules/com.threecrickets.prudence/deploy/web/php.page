<h2>Supported Scripting Language: PHP</h2>
<p>
PHP is, of course, ubiquitous. It's a simple language with the most mature libraries of any web scripting language, and programmers are available with years
of experience. It's also designed from the ground up as an scripting language for the web.
</p><p>
However, some of PHP's benefits and libraries will not be immediately usable under Restlet. PHP's built-in web scripting features, such as $_SESSION and $_COOKIE,
won't work. You'll need to use the Restlet versions instead, and some libraries may expect PHP's built-in features. (It may be possible to write a transition library -- any volunteers?) 
</p><p>
Note that Scripturian
replaces PHP's scriptlet scheme with its own. Usage and performance should be identical, but Scripturian's scheme is more powerful than PHP's,
because it allows for mixing languages in one file.
</p>

<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
<p>
PHP5 is implemented by Caucho's <a href="http://quercus.caucho.com/">Quercus</a>.
</p><p>
<i>Important!</i> At this time (version 3.2.1), Quercus cannot be used for creating REST resources, due to its very limited implementation of the
Java scripting standard. It is OK for scriptlets, though.
