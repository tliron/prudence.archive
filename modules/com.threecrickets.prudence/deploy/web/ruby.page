<h2>Supported Scripting Language: Ruby</h2>
<p>
And then there's Ruby, a relatively new language that can do most of what <a href="python.page">Python</a> can do and more. Unlike Python, it has a very loose and forgiving
syntax, which is perfect for scriptlets. It can work with many styles of code, and as such it would be relatively easy to transition to Ruby from
any of the above languages.
</p><p>
Ruby has some excellent libraries, and may be very productive for developing large applications.

<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
<p>
Ruby is implemented by <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby</a>. Note that you also need a small library for
<a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/scripting/">Java scripting standard (JSR-223)</a>, which is available 
at the <a href="https://scripting.dev.java.net/">Java scripting project</a>. (This was true for version 1.2.)
See the <a href="requirements.page">requirement notes</a> if you are using Java 5.
