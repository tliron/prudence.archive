<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>Java 5</h3>
<p>
The <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/scripting/">Java scripting standard (JSR-223)</a> was officially introduced
into Java 6. However, we realize that many projects still use Java 5, and that support for Java scripting is easy to add to Java 5.
For this reason, we have built Scripturian on Java 5, and tested it on both Java 5 and Java 6.
</p><p>
Included in Prudence is a library to add JSR-223 support to Java 5. You do not need this library if you are using Java 6.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the <a href="https://scripting.dev.java.net/">Java scripting project</a> assumes Java 6, and its released support libraries
will not work on Java 5. Luckily, it is relatively easy rebuild them for Java 5. To do this, simply check out the source code from CVS
and build on a Java 5 platform with the addition of the JSR-223 support library. In the full Prudence distribution, we've done
this for you.
