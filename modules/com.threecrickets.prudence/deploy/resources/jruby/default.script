#
# This script implements and handles a REST resource. Simply put, it is a state,
# addressed by a URL, that responds to verbs. Verbs represent logical operations
# on the state, such as create, read, update and delete (CRUD). They are primitive
# communications, which include very minimal session and no transaction state. As such,
# they are very straightforward to implement, and can lead to very scalable
# applications. 
#
# The exact URL of this resource depends on its its filename and/or its location in
# your directory structure. See your restoration.conf for more information.

# The expectation is that it return one representation, out of possibly many, of the

# org.restlet.resource.Representation. Other types will be automatically converted to
# string representation using the client's requested media type and character set.
# These, and the language of the representation (defaulting to None), can be read and
# changed via $document.container.media_type, $document.container.character_set, and

# Additionally, you can use $document.container.variant to interrogate the client's provided
# list of supported languages and encoding.

# to accept logically partial representations of the state.

# that will affect future calls to handle_get(). Unlike handle_post(),
# it is expected that the representation be logically complete.
